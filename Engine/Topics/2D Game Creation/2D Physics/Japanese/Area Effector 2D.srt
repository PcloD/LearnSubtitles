1
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:05,561
In Unity it's possible to add physics forces

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:08,250
to 2D objects within an area

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,250
using effectors.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,250
The Area Effector 2D allows us to

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,250
add physics forces to 2D object

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
which trigger or collide with it.

7
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:19,193
Some example uses for this might be to create

8
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,193
an area of a scene in which a fan

9
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:22,942
blows objects in a certain direction

10
00:00:23,304 --> 00:00:25,304
or to create a speed boost area

11
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:27,304
in a top-down driving game.

12
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:29,304
In our example scene we have a hat

13
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:31,220
which spawns coins.

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,716
The coin prefab contains a sprite renderer,

15
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:36,544
circle collider and rigid body collider 2D

16
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:38,115
with default values.

17
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,919
The coins fall in to our first

18
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:43,271
area effector 2D which is attached

19
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:45,271
to our game object ArrowsRight.

20
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,367
When they enter the collider they are propelled

21
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,367
to the right where they are caught and lifted

22
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,838
by our second area effector 2D

23
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,838
which is attached to ArrowsUp.

24
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,459
For an area effector to function it

25
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,459
must be attached to a game object which

26
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:03,459
also has a 2D collider.

27
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:08,657
On the box collider 2D attached to ArrowsRight

28
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:10,657
the Used By Effector field is

29
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,587
set to true.

30
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,587
If this field is not checked you'll see

31
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:17,573
a warning on your area effector component

32
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,573
that the effector will not function until

33
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,880
there is at least 1 enabled 2D collider

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,977
with Used By Effector checked on this game object.

35
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,516
Additionally the box collider 2D

36
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:30,516
should have it's Is Trigger field

37
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,516
checked and set to true.

38
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:35,251
This will allow the objects to enter 

39
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:38,820
the trigger volume in which they will be effected by

40
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:42,011
the forces set in the area effector settings.

41
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:46,132
Area effectors are designed to be used with triggers.

42
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:48,132
It's possible to use an area effector with 

43
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,437
non-trigger colliders, but the forces will

44
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:52,437
only be applied when the target collider

45
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,223
is in contact with the source.

46
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,643
To control what forces are applied

47
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:01,252
when an object enters the trigger volume

48
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:04,620
the area effector 2d the following settings.

49
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,508
The collider mask allows users to

50
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,910
include or exclude layers from being

51
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,910
effected by this effector's forces.

52
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,862
For more on layers please see the information linked below.

53
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,515
Here the effector is effecting everything.

54
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,583
The force direction is the angle at

55
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,583
which the force will be applied

56
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:30,396
in degrees ranging from 0 to 359.99

57
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:34,830
If we input a number greater than 359.99

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,019
it will clamp to 359.99.

59
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,366
If we use a negative value

60
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:43,366
the force direction will be applied

61
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,366
in the opposite direction.

62
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:49,985
The force direction is calculated in world space,

63
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:53,147
incrementing in a counter-clockwise direction.

64
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,243
If force direction is set to 0

65
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,169
the object will be pushed directly to the right.

66
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:02,490
If set to 90 it will be pushed upwards,

67
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,072
if set to 180 it will be pushed to the left

68
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:07,875
and if set to 270 it will be pushed down.

69
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,153
Note that the force direction is directly

70
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:13,153
relative to world space and not 

71
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,153
to the object's local rotation.

72
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,930
Rotating the object will not rotate

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,539
the direction which the force is applied in.

74
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:24,143
The force magnitude is the magnitude of the 

75
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:26,143
force to be applied to each object

76
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:29,072
while it remains within the trigger volume.

77
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,125
In this case we've set our force magnitude to 22,

78
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,125
to give our objects a relatively gentle

79
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,141
push towards our second effector.

80
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,337
The force variation here is set to 0.

81
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:45,337
Force variation allows us to

82
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:48,792
add or subtract a random amount

83
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:52,860
ranging from 0 to the amount specified.

84
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
by setting force variation to a positive

85
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
number we can add

86
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,691
between 0 and that number to the force magnitude

87
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,691
and by setting it to a negative number we 

88
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:06,645
can subtract between 0 and that number.

89
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:11,141
In the case of our first area effector 2D,

90
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,480
we've set the drag and angular drag to 0.

91
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,090
Modifying the drag values allows

92
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,670
us to add drag or angular drag

93
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,101
to 2D rigid bodies that enter the effector's trigger volume.

94
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,101
The drag coefficient specified in the 

95
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:27,101
area effector 2D are applied

96
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,530
in addition to any already set

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,561
in the target object's rigid body 2D settings.

98
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:36,537
In our second effector attached to ArrowsUp

99
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,537
we're using drag to catch and

100
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:40,980
slow down the incoming coins

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,506
so that we can then move them directly upwards.

102
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,242
If we temporarily reduce the drag value

103
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,242
from 10 to 0 we can see that the

104
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:51,579
velocity of the coins causes them to pass

105
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:54,992
through the trigger volume and out of it to the right.

106
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:01,944
To demonstrate the angular drag

107
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:05,840
and force target parameters of our area effector 2D

108
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
we've modified our scene slightly.

109
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,426
We've added our 2Planks game object

110
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:14,382
which has a rigid body 2D attached

111
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,382
with 2 child objects

112
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,675
which hold a sprite renderer

113
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:20,675
and box collider 2D.

114
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:24,855
We've also duplicated our ArrowsRight object

115
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:26,855
to make ArrowsRight2.

116
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,339
When we play our scene you can see

117
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,686
that the 2Planks object falls

118
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:35,368
in to the two ArrowsRight effectors,

119
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,978
is moved to the right,

120
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,673
and then is moved upwards by ArrowsUp.

121
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:43,844
Currently the angular drag is set to 0

122
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,844
and the force target is rigid body.

123
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:49,209
Because the force target is rigid body 

124
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,209
the force is applied to the centre

125
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,209
of mass of the rigid body

126
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:56,223
and therefore does not case rotation.

127
00:05:56,806 --> 00:06:00,482
If we highlight our 3 area effector objects

128
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:03,550
and switch the force target to collider

129
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,550
and then play our scene again

130
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,632
we can see that setting the

131
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:10,632
force target to collider causes

132
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,632
the object to rotate.

133
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Angular drag allows us to

134
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,173
slow an object's rotation

135
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,963
as we increase the drag value.

136
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,392
If we then switch the angular drag

137
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:28,646
value for all 3 area effectors 2Ds to 10

138
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,353
We can see that by increasing

139
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:35,136
angular drag the rotation still occurs

140
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:37,136
but is minimised.

141
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,539
For more on area effectors please see

142
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,539

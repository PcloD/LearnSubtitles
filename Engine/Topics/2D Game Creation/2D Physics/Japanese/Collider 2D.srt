1
00:00:01,215 --> 00:00:03,701
To have any physical presence in the scene

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,701
a game object must use one of the

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,826
collider components to define it's physical shape

4
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:11,783
and to interact with the relevant physics engine.

5
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,904
Unity has 2 physics engines.

6
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:17,719
One for 3D and one for 2D.

7
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:21,909
These two physics engines do not interact with each other.

8
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,783
For more information on physics and physics 2D

9
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:28,446
please see the information linked below.

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,429
When using the 2D physics engine

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,535
a collider 2D component must be used.

12
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:39,215
There are 4 collider 2D components to choose from.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,950
The circle collider 2D,

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,950
the box collider 2D,

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,335
the polygon collider 2D

16
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,623
and the edge collider 2D.

17
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:52,905
All of these collider components share many properties

18
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,905
as they all derive from the same generic

19
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,905
base collider 2D.

20
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,112
Each collider 2D component however is

21
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:02,112
optimised for a particular shape.

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,777
The circle collider 2D works with

23
00:01:04,777 --> 00:01:06,777
round circular objects.

24
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:11,607
The box collider 2D works well with rectangular objects.

25
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:14,357
The polygon collider 2D work

26
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:16,357
best with complex shapes.

27
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:21,263
And the edge collider 2D works well for surfaces.

28
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:26,458
The edge collider and polygon colliders are very similar.

29
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:30,000
They are created by several points, or vertices,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
with edges connecting them.

31
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:36,020
The main difference between them is that the polygon collider

32
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,882
must be a closed shape covering an area.

33
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,921
And the edge collider must be open,

34
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:45,207
defining an edge of one or more segments.

35
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:48,093
One good use of the edge collider

36
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,385
is to make a single solid surface

37
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:53,130
rather than a series of 2D colliders

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,379
even if several sprites are used to create

39
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,807
the visual aspect of the surface.

40
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,744
When comparing all 2D colliders

41
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:04,299
there are 2 properties exposed in the inspector

42
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,883
that they all share.

43
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:09,134
Is Trigger and Material.

44
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,808
The other unique properties are for defining

45
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:14,840
the shape of that particular 2D collider.

46
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:18,160
The Is Trigger property will set the collider

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
to behave as a trigger collider.

48
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,462
With normal 2D physics collisions

49
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,462
the 2D physics engine will prevent

50
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:28,332
2D colliders from passing through each other.

51
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,965
2D trigger colliders will not participate

52
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:35,036
in physical collisions and will send 2D

53
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,685
trigger messages rather than 2D collision messages.

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,420
These trigger messages can be used to

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,904
initiate new actions in the scene.

56
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,707
For more information on Is Trigger

57
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,707
and the messages sent by colliders

58
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,138
please see the information linked below.

59
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,381
The material property is a reference to the

60
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:59,556
physics material 2D being used by the collider 2D

61
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,556
and this can be none.

62
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,056
Physics materials define how colliders

63
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:06,056
will react when they collider

64
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,056
and define both the bounciness and

65
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,473
the friction of the collider's surface.

66
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,886
To make a bouncy ball or slippery ice covered platform

67
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,277
use a different physics material 2D

68
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:19,277
with each collider 2D.

69
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,281
For more information on physics material 2D

70
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:25,833
please see the information linked below.

71
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:30,188
To use a collider 2D it must be attached

72
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,649
to a game object.

73
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,013
One way of attaching a collider 2D component

74
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:37,342
is to use the Add Component button

75
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,342
and select Physics 2D

76
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:42,402
and select a Collider 2D Component.

77
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,442
For more information on game objects,

78
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,442
components and how to use them

79
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:49,856
please see the information linked below.

80
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:52,883
When a collider 2D component is attached

81
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:56,542
Unity will try to size the collider 2D to the sprite.

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
If the size and shape of the collider 2D

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,319
is undesirable then the shape can be edited by either

84
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,319
changing the values in the inspector

85
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:10,501
or changing the collider 2D itself in the scene view.

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,157
To edit a collider 2D in the scene view

87
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:16,157
hold down the shift key.

88
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,279
This will display handles on the 2D collider's

89
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
gizmo in the scene view.

90
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,779
These handles are drag-able.

91
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,362
In the case of the edge collider and the polygon collider

92
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,362
dragging an existing handle will move

93
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:34,389
the collider's vertex, and change the collider's shape

94
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,722
rather than resizing the collider.

95
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,121
By moving the cursor over an empty edge

96
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:43,024
on either the edge collider or the polygon collider

97
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:45,814
a new vertex can be created by clicking.

98
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:49,404
This is indicated by a new handle appearing

99
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:51,946
and the edge highlighting in green.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,752
In the case of the edge collider and the polygon collider

101
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:02,628
holding the control key will allow a

102
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,628
vertex to the be deleted when clicked.

103
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,529
This is indicated by the handle

104
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:09,529
and the edge highlighting in red.

105
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,784
A game object does not need a rigidbodied

106
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:21,340
2D to use a collider 2D.

107
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,778
To participate in 2D collision and trigger events

108
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,778
however at least 1 of the game objects

109
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:30,359
involved must have a rigidbody 2D attached.

110
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,025
A common pattern for best performance

111
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:35,507
would be to attach collider 2D components

112
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:37,507
but not rigidbody components

113
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:40,102
to all of the static, or non-moving game objects

114
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:42,648
that need to interact with 2D physics.

115
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:46,451
And attach a collider 2D and a rigidbody 2D

116
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,828
to the dynamic, or moving, game object

117
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,828
that need to interact in the scene.

118
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,840

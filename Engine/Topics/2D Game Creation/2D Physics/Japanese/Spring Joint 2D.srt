1
00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:02,044
The spring joint 2D component

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:04,044
allows you to create 2D springs

3
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:07,118
using your rigidbody 2D physics objects.

4
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:09,715
It can be added to your game object

5
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:11,206
from the physics 2D area

6
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:13,206
of the component menus.

7
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:16,632
In this example we have a plank

8
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:18,869
and a meteor, both of which are

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,456
2D physics objects,

10
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:22,360
meaning that they have rigidbody 2D 

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,084
components attached.

12
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:30,561
The meteor game object has the spring joint

13
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,421
2D component attached

14
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,766
as this is the object we which to 

15
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,766
affect with our spring.

16
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,418
A spring joint 2D can be attached

17
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:40,418
to your object if you wish it to be

18
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,013
affected by a spring.

19
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:44,013
But it also needs to be anchored to a point

20
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:45,131
in your scene.

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,524
This is defined by the connected rigidbody.

22
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:50,524
Here we have dragged our Plank game object

23
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:52,174
on to this property.

24
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:55,584
Note that this plank is a kinematic rigidbody.

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,689
This means that it won't be affected by physics.

26
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,640
it won't be pulled down by the meteor being attached.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
This is perfect for an anchor point.

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Let's look at this in action.

29
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:15,726
As we can see, the meteor is attached to the plank.

30
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,035
And in the scene view we can see that there are

31
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:22,035
gizmos representing the spring.

32
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:24,311
If I move the meteor

33
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:26,893
the spring reacts.

34
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:29,365
And if I move the plank

35
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:31,539
the spring continues to act

36
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,917
on our meteor.

37
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:37,644
If we want to offset the position of our anchor point

38
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:39,644
or where it attaches to our meteor

39
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:42,091
we can use the anchor, or connected anchor

40
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:43,443
X and Y values.

41
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:47,783
You can see this using the gizmo in the scene view.

42
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,691
Adjusting the anchor will adjust the

43
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,691
position of connection.

44
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
And adjusting the connected anchor

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,766
will adjust the position of anchoring

46
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,533
to the connected rigidbody.

47
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,381
So if your sprite has a point that makes

48
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,381
visual sense to attach to you can use this

49
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,672
offset to attach the spring here.

50
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:09,212
For example, we may want to connect

51
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,212
to the edge of our meteor.

52
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,668
The distance is how long the spring should be.

53
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:35,431
And the frequency acts as a strength value.

54
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,431
Having a low frequency makes for a very

55
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:39,431
slow bouncing response.

56
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:49,202
And having a high frequency makes for a very tight spring.

57
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,938
Damping ratio is a value from 0 to 1

58
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,646
which will allow you to dampen the response of the spring,

59
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,646
slowing it's affect on your object.

60
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,834
As with all of the physics 2D components

61
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,834
the best thing to do is to play around with these values

62
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,834
until you find something that feels satisfactory

63
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,910
for your game play and visuals.

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,423

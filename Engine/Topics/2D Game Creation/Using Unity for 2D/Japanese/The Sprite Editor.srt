1
00:00:01,257 --> 00:00:03,709
The Sprite Editor is used to take images

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:07,689
containing multiple elements like an atlas or sprite sheet

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,338
and slice them in to individual sprites.

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,277
It is important that the sprite mode of the image

5
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:18,277
is set to Multiple.

6
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,371
Images with sprite modes set to single

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,443
cannot use the sprite editor window at this time.

8
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:29,033
For more information on sprites, sprite mode and the sprite type

9
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,033
please see the information link below.

10
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:34,679
When sprite mode multiple is selected

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,000
the sprite editor button will appear on the

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
texture importer in the inspector.

13
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,300
Click the sprite editor button to open the sprite editor.

14
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:47,445
The sprite editor can also be opened by selecting

15
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:50,452
Window  - Sprite Editor.

16
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:55,568
The sprite editor window is a standard Unity window.

17
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:58,529
It can be used and docked like any other window.

18
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:02,536
To create sprites in the sprite editor window

19
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,673
slice the image by clicking and dragging

20
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,423
over the desired elements.

21
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:10,531
This will create rectangular selections that define each sprite.

22
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:13,445
The rectangular selection can be adjusted

23
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:15,445
by clicking and dragging the rectangle.

24
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,856
Click and drag anywhere inside the rectangle to move it.

25
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:24,286
Click and drag any of the corners or edges to resize it.

26
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,095
Click and drag the pivot point gizmo to move

27
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:33,318
the pivot point for that sprite.

28
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:39,981
When a sprite is selected a sprite panel appears

29
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:41,981
in the lower right of the sprite editor

30
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,607
with details about the selected sprite.

31
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:47,614
Name is the name of the sprite.

32
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,731
The name is created from the name of the original image

33
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:54,364
and the order in which it was sliced from that image,

34
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,944
starting with 0.

35
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,203
Position defines where the sprite

36
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:00,203
is on the image, in pixels.

37
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:04,153
X and Y define the start point of the sprite.

38
00:02:04,153 --> 00:02:06,153
measured from the lower left corner of the image.

39
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:08,805
to the lower left corner of the sprite.

40
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,955
W and H define the width and height

41
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,955
of the sprite, from the start point.

42
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,416
The trim button can be used to trim off any

43
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,306
excess space around the element,

44
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,978
creating the tightest fitting rectangle possible.

45
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,334
Pivot sets the pivot point for this sprite.

46
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,291
The pivot drop-down menu includes presets

47
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,995
for each corner and the centre of each edge.

48
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,269
Custom allows for a custom pivot point

49
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,890
to be set numerically under Custom Pivot.

50
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,300
Along the top of the sprite editor are a

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,859
number of tools.

52
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,203
The slice menu,

53
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:48,896
the revert and apply buttons,

54
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,672
the RGB alpha toggle

55
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,683
and the zoom slider.

56
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,140
The slice menu is used to automatically create sprites

57
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,785
by slicing the sprite elements from the image.

58
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,018
The slice type is either automatic or grid.

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,499
Automatic is best for slicing individual

60
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:12,499
uneven elements, like from an atlas.

61
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,648
Elements on the image are automatically

62
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,939
detected based on the empty space around them.

63
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,896
Each sprite will have effectively been trimmed

64
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,146
as a result.

65
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:26,301
With automatic selected minimum size defines the

66
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:29,123
minimum size for each individual sprite.

67
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:32,697
If this value is set too high smaller elements

68
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:34,697
that are near each other could be combined

69
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,780
in to 1 larger sprite to meet

70
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,780
the minimum size requirements.

71
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,667
Pivot sets the default pivot point that will

72
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,585
be applied to all sprites when they are

73
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,115
spiced from the image.

74
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,644
Just like the sprite panel, the pivot drop-down menu

75
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:52,683
includes presets for each corner and the centre of each edge.

76
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,750
To set a custom pivot, once the sprites have been sliced

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
select any sprite and adjust it's pivot point

78
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,750
in the sprite panel,

79
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,054
or adjust it visually in the editor.

80
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,825
Method lets you choose how to deal with existing

81
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:10,060
sprites in the sprite editor window.

82
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:13,334
Delete Existing will replace any sprites

83
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,705
that already exist with new sprites.

84
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,842
Smart will attempt to create new sprites

85
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,329
while retaining and adjusting existing ones.

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Safe will add new sprites without

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,685
changing any sprites already created.

88
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:31,944
When the settings are correct select the Slice button

89
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:34,695
to slice the image in to individual sprites.

90
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:39,232
After slicing, each sprite can be edited individually.

91
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:44,094
With the sprite sheet, where each element is designed

92
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:46,784
to be a regular identical size,

93
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:49,508
if Slice Type Automatic is used

94
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,352
small changes in the individual sprite's shape

95
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,352
and the amount of empty space surrounding it

96
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:57,161
could cause the sprites to be cut out unevenly.

97
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:01,777
To evenly slice a sprite sheet made of regular elements

98
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,777
choose Slice Type Grid.

99
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:09,202
Pixel Size sets the size of the grid in pixels.

100
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:13,151
Pivot sets the default pivot point that will be applied

101
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,136
to all sprites when they are sliced from the image.

102
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:19,235
To set a custom pivot, once the sprites have been sliced,

103
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,595
select any sprite and adjust it's pivot point

104
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:24,956
in the sprite panel, or adjust it visually in the editor.

105
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,340
When the settings are correct use the slice button

106
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,895
to slice the image in to individual sprites.

107
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:35,341
After slicing each sprite can be edited individually.

108
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,990
When slicing is complete, to save any changes,

109
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,990
select Apply.

110
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:44,454
Or discard any change by selecting Revert.

111
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,487
The RGB Alpha toggle switches the

112
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:51,587
display of the sprite editor between the colour image

113
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:54,146
and it's alpha channel, making it easier to see

114
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,849
fine details when manually adjusting edges.

115
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:01,418
The zoom slider controls the zoom when viewing the image.

116
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,589
When an image has been successfully edited

117
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:07,589
and the changes applied

118
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:10,494
the asset will update in the project window.

119
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,566
And a new sprite, or set of sprites

120
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:17,082
can be seen as a child or group of children

121
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,579
under the image.

122
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,833
When viewing thumbnails in the project view

123
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,676
click the turn-down arrow to see any children.

124
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,136
Each child represents a useable sprite from that image.

125
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,662
Any of these sprites can be used in the

126
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:35,459
project independently, or grouped together

127
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,459
to create a character, for example,

128
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,776
or used sequentially as animations.

1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:03,165
In Unity avatars are definitions that tell

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:05,165
the animation system how to animate

3
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:06,832
the transforms of a model.

4
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:10,380
For humanoid models these can be configured

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,380
to your own specifications.

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,653
When you select a mesh in a Project panel

7
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:17,807
the Inspector will have three tabs,

8
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:20,499
Model, Rig and Animations.

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,287
To configure the avatar click the rig tab.

10
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,685
For this tutorial we are assuming that

11
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:30,114
the model is a humanoid, as such

12
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,809
the animation type should be humanoid.

13
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:37,025
Below that is the avatar definition property.

14
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,110
The options are Create From This Model,

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,110
and Copy From Other Avatar.

16
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:45,095
Copy From Other Avatar simply copies

17
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:47,095
an avatar definition from one that has

18
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,789
already been configured.

19
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:51,832
In most cases Unity will be able to 

20
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,067
configure your model automatically,

21
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,411
in which case you will see a tick mark

22
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:58,411
next to the configure button.

23
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:01,461
Otherwise it can be configured manually.

24
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:04,345
We will discuss configuring an avatar

25
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:07,025
manually in just a moment, but first

26
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,343
let's finish talking about the Rig tab,

27
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:13,230
specifically the Optimise Game Objects check box.

28
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:18,007
By default Unity does not optimise model rigging.

29
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:20,593
What that means is that Unity will create

30
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:22,593
many empty game objects to represent

31
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:24,593
all of the model's bones and joints.

32
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,231
This gives you access to the transforms of all

33
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,664
of the model's parts, but it is much less efficient.

34
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,773
In most cases you will not need this

35
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:34,137
level of control.

36
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,957
Therefore it is recommended to check

37
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:39,957
Optimise Game Objects.

38
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,709
By checking this box Unity will not create

39
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,961
extra empty game objects.

40
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:49,136
Obviously not managing all of those transforms

41
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:51,385
will improve the performance of your game.

42
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,820
However under some circumstances

43
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,485
we might want to reference a particular

44
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:59,362
part of a model in code or in the Hierarchy.

45
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:02,819
We might, for example, want to add a cup of

46
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,819
coffee to the hand of the model.

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,129
We can still complete this in an optimised model

48
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,623
by exposing the transforms we want.

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,195
To expose a transform click the + sign under the

50
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,176
Extra Transforms To Expose box.

51
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:20,001
Then simply drill down and find the

52
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,767
transform you want.

53
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,767
In this case we will drill down

54
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,767
to find the model's right hand.

55
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,578
If you change the optimisation of a model

56
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:34,467
you will need to reconfigure the avatar

57
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,398
definition afterwards.

58
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:39,266
To do this click on the Configure button.

59
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,766
You will be asked if you want to keep the

60
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,766
unapplied import settings you have made

61
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:47,212
to the model, choose apply to keep your changes.

62
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,620
If you have unsaved changes to your scene

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,006
Unity will also ask if you want to save them

64
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,585
because configuring an avatar is done in another scene.

65
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:00,453
The configuration scene is empty

66
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:02,635
apart from our model with it's entire

67
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,635
hierarchy exposed.

68
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:09,312
The Inspector has 2 tabs, Mapping and Muscles.

69
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:11,312
First we will discuss Mapping.

70
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:14,364
This is the mapping of the model's imported

71
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,685
hierarchy to Unity's definition for how

72
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,685
a humanoid should be laid out.

73
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,303
Immediately below the tabs is a representation

74
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,149
of the humanoid model with various

75
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,504
circles and dots.

76
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:28,691
These represent the bones of the model.

77
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,273
Ones that are circled with a dotted line

78
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:33,384
are optional and are not necessary

79
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:34,890
for the definition.

80
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,706
On the diagram you can select which

81
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,651
part of the model you are looking at.

82
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,394
The body, head or either hand

83
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:45,286
by clicking the buttons on the left side.

84
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,260
Below the diagram is a list of all of the bones

85
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,667
organised by section with a transform that

86
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,667
has been applied to that bone.

87
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,036
In order to apply a transform to a bone

88
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,036
you can either drag the transform from the

89
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:01,702
hierarchy to the dots on the diagram,

90
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:04,451
the specific property below the diagram

91
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,922
or you can use the circle select button.

92
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:10,946
Below the list of bones are 2 drop-down menus,

93
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,946
Mapping and Pose.

94
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,487
Mapping has 4 options.

95
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:19,186
Clear, Automap, Load and Save.

96
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:23,331
Clear will remove all of the bone allocations.

97
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:26,880
Automap will get Unity to try and fit the

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,021
correct transforms to their bones.

99
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:31,456
Generally this is the best approach

100
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:34,019
to start with when configuring an avatar.

101
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,105
Load and Save are for dealing with

102
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,105
humanoid templates so you can use

103
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:41,748
configurations across multiple avatars.

104
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,310
These are generally not required

105
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,310
as Unity will usually be able to automap

106
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,721
your avatar.

107
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:50,691
The Pose drop-down has 3 options.

108
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:55,383
Reset, Sample Bind Pose and Enforce T-Pose.

109
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,686
Reset removes any pose from the avatar

110
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:00,686
and sets it to it's default.

111
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:04,428
Sample Bind Pose tries to set the avatar to

112
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:06,428
the pose in which it was modelled.

113
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,751
Enforce T-Pose sets the avatar

114
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,413
in to a T pose.

115
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,664
This is the way that Unity prefers to

116
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,502
deal with avatars.

117
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,502
When you have finished mapping it is best

118
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,218
to set the avatar in to a T pose.

119
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:24,025
When you have finished mapping your avatar's bones

120
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,122
click Apply to keep the changes.

121
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:27,774
Then click on the Muscles tab

122
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:29,774
to deal with the model's muscles.

123
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:33,059
If you have unapplied import settings

124
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,451
Unity will ask if you wish to apply them.

125
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:40,638
Under the Muscles tab are 3 groups of settings.

126
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,138
The first group is just for previewing

127
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,842
the overall range of movement of the avatar.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,015
And if you're going to adjust any of the

129
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,007
muscle ranges it is best to leave these

130
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,888
at their default by clicking the

131
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:54,888
Reset All button.

132
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,725
The second group of settings are the

133
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,725
Per-Muscle settings.

134
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,084
These are grouped by body areas

135
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,279
and each one takes the form of a slider

136
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,942
which can be used to adjust the range

137
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,304
of muscle movement.

138
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:12,806
The number's range between -180 and 180,

139
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,438
representing the number of degrees of

140
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,438
movement around that axis.

141
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:20,918
The third section is for additional settings.

142
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,440
The Twist settings are how much of the

143
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
twist affects the neighbouring joints.

144
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,591
The Stretch settings, for how much the bones

145
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:31,333
can stretch when the avatar is retargeted

146
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,714
to another model.

147
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,572
Finally the Feet Spacing

148
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:37,823
is the default distance between the feet.

149
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,473
You can use this to affect things

150
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,473
like walking animations.

151
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,972
Once you have set the muscles as you like

152
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,416
you can apply your changes and press Done

153
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,416
to return to your scene.

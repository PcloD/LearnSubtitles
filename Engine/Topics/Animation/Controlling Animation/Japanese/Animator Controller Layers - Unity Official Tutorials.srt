1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,129
The state machines of animator controllers

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,129
can be split up in to layers.

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,251
These are generally used to handle

4
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:08,973
animating different body parts.

5
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:12,243
For example you might use the base layer

6
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:14,714
to handle the overall movement of a character

7
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,170
while also allowing the character to wave.

8
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:19,628
You could handle the separate waving animation

9
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,628
on another layer so that the character

10
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:24,443
could move and wave simultaneously.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,812
By default an animator controller will

12
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:30,253
have one layer called Base Layer.

13
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,782
The only adjustable properties for this layer

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,017
are it's name and whether or not it does

15
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,797
an IK Pass.

16
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:39,988
IK is short for Inverse Kinematics.

17
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:42,764
When a layer does an IK pass

18
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:45,588
it means that the onAnimatorIK function

19
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,588
will be called for that layer with the

20
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,588
appropriate layer index.

21
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,289
The base layer has a layer index of 0.

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,442
Any additional layers have indices

23
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,890
starting at 1 and counting upwards.

24
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,107
For more information on IK and the

25
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,330
onAnimatorIK function

26
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,030
please see the documentation linked below.

27
00:01:06,128 --> 00:01:08,128
Subsequent layers have additional options

28
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:10,753
to do with how they react to previous layers.

29
00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:13,598
We can create a new layer by clicking the

30
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:16,424
+ icon next to the word Layers.

31
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,726
All layers have a name and that is set with

32
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:21,423
the Name property.

33
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,423
The Weight represents how much the layer

34
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,326
effects the final animation.

35
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:27,408
A weight of 0 means the layer will not

36
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:29,185
effect animation at all.

37
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:31,240
Inversely a weight of 1

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
will completely change the animation.

39
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,392
Layers of higher weights have priority

40
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:37,795
over lower ones.

41
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:41,195
The slider sets the default value of the weight

42
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:43,694
but it can still be set in code at runtime

43
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:46,450
using the setLayerWeight function

44
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,450
of the animator class.

45
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:51,757
The Mask property of a layer defines which,

46
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,246
if any, avatar mask the layer will use

47
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,789
to isolate body parts for animation.

48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,851
For more information about avatar masks

49
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:01,851
see the lesson linked below.

50
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,055
The blending of a layer can either be

51
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:07,055
Override or Additive.

52
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,790
If the blending mode is override

53
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,790
then the resultant animation will override

54
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,790
the animation of the lower layer

55
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,790
as defined by the weight.

56
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:18,331
Additive blending will result in the

57
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,801
animations on the additive layer being added to

58
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,801
or combined with the animations

59
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,106
of lower layers.

60
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,917
An example of this might be using a layer

61
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,917
to represent a character breathing heavily

62
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,875
as they become tired.

63
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,875
In this example the heavy breathing

64
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,029
animation would be added to an animation

65
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:37,903
defined on the lower layers.

66
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,682
The weight could be used to measure how

67
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,682
tired the character was.

68
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,765
As the weight of the layer increased

69
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,667
the heavy breathing animation would be

70
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,900
more apparent.

71
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:50,016
The last option for a layer is Sync.

72
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,182
Where you check the Sync box

73
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:54,099
you are given an option of which layer

74
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,683
you wish to sync with.

75
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:58,183
This will create an identical state machine

76
00:02:58,183 --> 00:02:59,974
to the one on the selected layer

77
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,529
but with no motions.

78
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:04,071
This means that the animator will always

79
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:06,462
be in the same state in both layers.

80
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,887
This can be used for things such as

81
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,319
a wounded behaviour.

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,045
If you have a set of animations for when

83
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:14,045
the character is healthy and a set for

84
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:16,045
when the character is wounded these can be

85
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:18,982
blended between as the character looses health.

86
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:22,395
The Timing checkbox allows the animator

87
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,339
to adjust how long each animation

88
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:27,958
in synced layers takes determined by the weight.

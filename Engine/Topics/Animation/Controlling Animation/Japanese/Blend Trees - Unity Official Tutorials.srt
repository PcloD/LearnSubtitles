1
00:00:00,525 --> 00:00:03,046
Sometimes when animating you want a mix

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,046
of two or more animations.

3
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:08,293
For example if you have animations

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:10,788
for running left, running forward

5
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:13,761
and running right you might want animations

6
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:16,764
for running only slightly to the left or right.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,040
Another common example is having

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,512
walking and running animations

9
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,512
but wanting the character to be able to move

10
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:26,332
at different speeds between the two.

11
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,983
Blend trees can be used to achieve this.

12
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:33,939
To create a blend tree right-click on empty space

13
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,939
in the animator window.

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,203
Choose Create State - From New Blend Tree.

15
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,521
This creates a state that has a blend tree

16
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,446
as it's motion instead of a single animation.

17
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,278
Double clicking on the state allows you to

18
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:49,947
edit the blend tree.

19
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:52,723
The breadcrumb in the upper left hand corner

20
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:55,405
shows us that we are working in our blend tree.

21
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,914
Clicking the base layer name will bring us

22
00:00:57,914 --> 00:00:59,914
back out of the blend tree.

23
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,781
With the blend tree selected we can see it's

24
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,781
properties in the Inspector.

25
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,988
The first thing to note is that

26
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,905
blend tree's have names.

27
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:11,725
These can be different from the state

28
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,086
that holds them.

29
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,852
Next comes the blend type.

30
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:18,352
For now we will be concentrating on

31
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,036
one dimensional blend trees.

32
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,548
We will be coming back to the different types

33
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,548
of 2 dimensional blend trees later.

34
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,849
One dimensional blend trees use a single

35
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:29,849
parameter to control how much of each

36
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:31,849
of it's motions should be played.

37
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,528
In the example given earlier of

38
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,184
running left or right the blend tree's

39
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,184
parameter might be something like

40
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,623
direction or angular speed.

41
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:44,332
Or for the walking/running example

42
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:46,332
the parameter could be speed.

43
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,730
Next is the list of motions.

44
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:53,277
To add motions click the + icon.

45
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:57,064
This gives you the options of Ad Motion Field,

46
00:01:57,064 --> 00:01:59,064
and New Blend Tree.

47
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:01,646
Selecting New Blend Tree

48
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,005
allows you to have nested blend trees

49
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,005
so you can blend animations 

50
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,005
based on more than one parameter.

51
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,802
However, if you wish to do this

52
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:14,453
an easier approach is usually

53
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:16,453
to use 2 dimensional blend trees.

54
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:19,629
As such we'll be dealing with

55
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,629
just adding motion fields.

56
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:25,605
Each motion field represents an animation.

57
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,716
These can be dragged on from the Assets

58
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:31,002
in the Project panel or selected from a list

59
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:33,405
by using the circle select button.

60
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,552
Each motion field then has 3 properties.

61
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:40,135
The threshold is the value of the

62
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,039
parameter you have selected

63
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,757
that represents a blend using entirely this animation.

64
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:48,437
For example, let's say you have a walking

65
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:51,239
and running animation and their thresholds

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,163
are 5 and 10  respectively.

67
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:57,453
If the Speed parameter is set to 10

68
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:58,964
then the blend tree will play just

69
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:00,964
the running animation.

70
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:05,410
If it's set to 7.5 it will play a 50/50 blend

71
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,410
of walking and running.

72
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:10,893
The next property is the Time Scale.

73
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,501
This affects the speed the animation is played at

74
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,906
just the same as the speed property

75
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,906
for normal states.

76
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,845
The last property decides whether or not

77
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:24,816
the animation is mirrored left to right.

78
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,600
After adding motion fields you'll notice that a

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,919
blue cross pattern diagram appears

80
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,919
above the list of motions.

81
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,835
This is an illustration of where the different

82
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:39,253
motions lay on the scale of the parameter.

83
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:41,323
The lowest threshold on the left,

84
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:43,323
the highest on the right.

85
00:03:44,154 --> 00:03:46,546
You can use the red scrubber to preview the

86
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,232
blended animation for various values.

87
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,367
If you wish to change the order of the motions

88
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,618
on a blend tree for any reason

89
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,618
you can drag the motions around using

90
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:59,995
the handle on the left of the motion property.

91
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:03,814
Below the list of motions are a few properties

92
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,387
that help adjust the attributes of your motions.

93
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,067
Generally it's a good idea to use these options

94
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,475
once you have added all of the motion

95
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:14,615
fields you need and given them animations.

96
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:18,655
If Automate Thresholds is checked

97
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,200
then the thresholds you have for each

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,668
animation will be set and won't be changeable.

99
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,569
If it is unchecked then we can use

100
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,569
the following 2 options.

101
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,069
Compute Thresholds will calculate

102
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,779
and set values for the thresholds of each

103
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,457
of your motion fields.

104
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,056
It will do this based on a property of

105
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,390
root motion, which you select.

106
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:43,490
These properties are Speed, Velocity X,

107
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,264
Velocity Y, Velocity Z

108
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:49,142
and Angular Speed in either radians

109
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,142
or degrees.

110
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,443
Since blend trees often have their thresholds

111
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:57,030
based on these root motion properties

112
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,849
these are also common examples

113
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,849
of animator parameters.

114
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,103
Using Adjust Time Scale

115
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,103
you can make the speed for each animation

116
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,964
homogenous.

117
00:05:08,964 --> 00:05:10,756
This means that each of the animations

118
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:13,969
will result in the same speed of root motion.

119
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,229
2 dimensional blend trees work in a very

120
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,097
similar way to 1 dimensional blend trees

121
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:22,497
but blend according to 2 parameters

122
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,221
instead of 1.

123
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:28,046
There are 3 types of 2D blend trees.

124
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:31,710
The first 2 are for blending based on direction.

125
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,478
They are 2D Simple Directional

126
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,909
and 2D Freeform Directional.

127
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,668
The last type is 2D Freeform Cartesian

128
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:42,668
and it is used for situations where the

129
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,138
parameters do not represent direction.

130
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:48,675
2D Simple Directional is used for

131
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:50,675
when you want to blend movement based

132
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,092
on directional parameters and have single

133
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,966
animations on each direction,

134
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:59,704
such as walk forward, walk back, walk left, etcetera.

135
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:03,781
2D Freeform Directional is used similarly

136
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,991
but can include multiple animations

137
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,522
in the same direction.

138
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:11,469
For example walk forward and run forward.

139
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,704
2D Freeform Cartesian is used when the

140
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:18,256
parameters are not based on direction,

141
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:21,783
for example speed and angular speed.

142
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:24,835
Creating each of these types of blend trees

143
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,502
works the same.

144
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,502
Once you have chosen a type

145
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,502
choose an animator parameter to represent

146
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:34,429
the X axis and one to represent the Y axis.

147
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,164
For the directional types a standard

148
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:41,020
X axis parameter might be velocity X.

149
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,764
And a standard Y axis parameter might be

150
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:45,764
velocity Z.

151
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,346
For Freeform Cartesian

152
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,346
this choice is more open.

153
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,777
Once you have chosen your parameters the next step

154
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:56,693
is to add motions.

155
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:59,012
Just as with 2D blend trees

156
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:02,108
these can be either blend trees or motion fields.

157
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:05,568
However unlike 1D blend trees

158
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:08,555
the order in which they are added doesn't matter.

159
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,463
Once you have added motions you will see a

160
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,463
diagram of where the motions are

161
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,463
according to their thresholds.

162
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,499
This again works the same as

163
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,286
1D blend trees, but since it is based on

164
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:25,097
2 thresholds, an X threshold and a Y threshold

165
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,097
the diagram is in 2 dimensions.

166
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,746
Each of the motions can be positioned manually

167
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,746
by dragging them on the diagram

168
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,319
positioned by setting the thresholds manually

169
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,376
or by using the Computer Positions option.

170
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,127
This works the same as the Compute Thresholds

171
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,003
option for 1D blend trees but computes the

172
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:46,824
threshold based on both parameters.

173
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,070
1 dimensional blend trees use a red scrubber

174
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,070
to preview the motion.

175
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,912
For 2D blend trees there is a red dot

176
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,912
that can be dragged around.

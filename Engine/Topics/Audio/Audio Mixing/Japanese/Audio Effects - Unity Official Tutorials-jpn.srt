1
00:00:00,769 --> 00:00:03,896
In Unity it's possible to process

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:07,591
our audio signals with audio effects

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,547
and shape their timbre, frequency content,

4
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:13,828
or the dynamics of their volume.

5
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:18,275
We can do this by adding audio effects

6
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:21,021
to a group in an audio mixer.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,706
In our scene we have 4 game objects,

8
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,873
each with an audio source which contains a loop

9
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:31,259
of a different element of a musical track.

10
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:36,219
All of these are routed in to audio mixer 1.

11
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,275
Audio mixer 1 currently has an

12
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:44,064
attenuation effect which is there by default

13
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:46,064
on the master channel.

14
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,660
If we play our scene

15
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:52,055
activate Edit In Play Mode

16
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,900
we can adjust the volume

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,543
of the attenuation effect

18
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:00,973
and thereby control the volume of the master group.

19
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:05,060
Notice that as we adjust the volume

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,060
the changes in volume are reflected

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,062
in the volume parameter in the inspector.

22
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:13,093
It's important to note that when we make

23
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:17,517
changes in play mode those changes will be saved

24
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,852
to the audio mixer asset.

25
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:23,304
Unlike changes made to the scene hierarchy

26
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:25,304
for example which will be reset

27
00:01:25,304 --> 00:01:27,487
when we exit play mode.

28
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,321
In order to apply effects processors

29
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:33,138
to the audio signal passing through the master we can

30
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:35,592
add them from the drop down menu.

31
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:40,822
We're going to add a low pass simple effect.

32
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,631
The low pass simple effect is a low pass

33
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:46,631
filter which allows us to attenuate

34
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:49,851
frequencies above the cut off frequency.

35
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,851
The default is 5000hz.

36
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:53,804
If we play our project.

37
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,429
Edit in play mode

38
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,429
and adjust the cut-off frequency

39
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:04,692
We can hear that the high frequencies are attenuated.

40
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:10,012
Audio effects are applied sequentially.

41
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:12,012
So in this cast the attenuation effect

42
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,652
is going to be applied first followed by

43
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:16,304
the low pass simple effect.

44
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,687
We'll add a distortion effect

45
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,881
and listen to the resulting signal.

46
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,775
We can hear that the distortion

47
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:41,765
adds high and mid-range harmonics

48
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:44,451
which were not previously present in the signal.

49
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,468
In this case the distortion is sequenced

50
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,738
after the low pass simple so

51
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,738
the high frequencies are attenuated

52
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:57,890
and then new mid and high frequencies are added.

53
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,890
If we want to change this order we can click

54
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,169
on the low pass simple and drag it down

55
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:05,169
so that it now occurs after

56
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,608
the distortion in the signal chain and we can listen to the effect.

57
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,118
What we can hear is that as we

58
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,415
attenuate the high frequencies using the low pass

59
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:28,795
it's cancelling out the effect of the distortion effect

60
00:03:28,795 --> 00:03:32,620
because the distorted signal is being run sequentially

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,620
through the low pass simple effect.

62
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,022
Let's check out another example.

63
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,022
Here we have the Nightmares project,

64
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:41,424
which you can download from the assets store.

65
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:44,314
And what we've done is we've

66
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:48,176
routed our background music to an audio mixer,

67
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,176
to this music group here, and we've

68
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,695
added a low pass filter effect.

69
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:55,849
We've also created two

70
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,849
audio mixer snapshots.

71
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,830
Audio mixer snapshots allow us to

72
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,806
save and recall the settings in the mixer.

73
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:06,301
In the Unpaused snapshot the cut-off

74
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,301
frequency for the low pass filter is

75
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:10,881
all the way up at 22000hz.

76
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,342
In the Paused snapshot we've pulled it down to 365hz.

77
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,739
This is going to attenuate the high frequencies

78
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,959
and give the music a muffled sound

79
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,401
when the paused snapshot is called.

80
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,401
The script which controls our paused menu

81
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,222
also controls the transition to these snapshots.

82
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:30,685
For more about snapshots and controlling them via script

83
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:32,501
see the information linked below.

84
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,658
Let's check this out and hear how it sounds.

85
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:41,478
Press escape.

86
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:47,514
And then press escape again to resume.

87
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,553
This is an example of how we can use

88
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:55,011
audio effects processing to convey information to

89
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,011
the player about the game state.

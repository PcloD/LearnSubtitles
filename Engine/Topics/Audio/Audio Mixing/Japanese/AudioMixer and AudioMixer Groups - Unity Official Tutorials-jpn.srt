1
00:00:00,944 --> 00:00:04,506
The audio mixer asset in Unity allows us

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:07,384
a great deal of control over the signal flow

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,991
of audio in our projects.

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,011
By default our main camera

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:17,793
is assigned an audio listener component.

6
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:21,058
The audio listener component is where audio

7
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:23,058
is output from the scene

8
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:27,142
to the headphones or the speakers of the listener

9
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:31,504
In Unity all audio starts at an audio source.

10
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,378
Here we have a game object called Base

11
00:00:34,378 --> 00:00:38,068
and it's got an audio source on it which has a clip

12
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,629
of a baseline loaded,

13
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,174
which is also set to play on awake and loop.

14
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:46,433
There are 3 other objects

15
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,375
which contain other musical parts including

16
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,375
an arpeggio kick and percussion.

17
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,581
When we play the scene we're going to hear these

18
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,461
first 3 parts play directly through

19
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:59,461
the audio listener component.

20
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,662
If we want to get more control over how

21
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:12,016
our audio is processed we can create an

22
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:16,120
audio mixer asset, so choose Create

23
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,620
Audio Mixer

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,620
and then we can either double click on it

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,620
to make it visible

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,489
or we can go to Window - Audio Mixer

27
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,489
or choose command-8

28
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,288
on Mac or control-8 on PC.

29
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:34,357
The audio mixer can be docked

30
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,777
like many of the other windows,

31
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:37,777
I'm going to dock it down here on the bottom of my screen

32
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:40,334
and I'm going to expand

33
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,334
to give myself a little bit more real estate.

34
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,334
The default state for an audio mixer

35
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:46,334
is that it's created only

36
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,524
with a master group here.

37
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:53,039
In Unity's audio system we refer to channels

38
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,039
as groups because they provide a little

39
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,633
bit of additional audio functionality

40
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,633
that a normal mixer channel would not.

41
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:03,020
Now, we've got our master

42
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,858
and currently nothing is assigned to it.

43
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,635
If we play we'll see

44
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,357
no movement in the meters.

45
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:13,746
If we choose our


46
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:17,927
game objects here we can edit

47
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:21,633
for all of them the output parameter here

48
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:24,424
and we can assign it by clicking on it

49
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:27,792
to the master channel of audio mixer 1.

50
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,056
Now when we play

51
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,029
we've setup some signal flow,

52
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,029
our signal is now passing from

53
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:39,273
our audio sources through the master

54
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,983
to the audio listener on the main camera.

55
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,983
By default the master group

56
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:48,486
is created with an attenuation effect applied to it.

57
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,486
The attenuation effect is what allows

58
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,790
us to control the volume of the signal

59
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,790
passing through the master group.

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,232
If we want to adjust that while we're playing

61
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:04,175
we're going to need to click Edit In Play Mode.

62
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,969
Now we can adjust the volume

63
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,933
and we can see in the inspector on the right

64
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,950
that the change is being reflected.

65
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,950
Changes made while editing

66
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,682
during play mode will be saved

67
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,682
to the audio mixer asset.

68
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:28,983
Unlike scene changes, which will revert

69
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:30,983
when exiting play mode.

70
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,967
Currently audio mixer 1 has only 1 group

71
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,329
the master.

72
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,195
To create a more flexible signal flow

73
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,900
we're going to go over here to the Groups area

74
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,686
and click the + button twice.

75
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:48,144
When we click the + button a new group

76
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,144
will be created that is the child

77
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,144
of the currently selected group.

78
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:56,301
Notice that in the channel strip view

79
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,080
group A and group B have appeared.

80
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
With multiple groups in our mixer we can

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,192
now assign some of our parts to different groups

82
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,192
Let's assign the kick drum

83
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,211
by clicking on the output parameter

84
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,900
to group A.

85
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,439
Now if we play

86
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,650
activate Edit In Play Mode.

87
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:26,303
You'll notice that when we turn down group A

88
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:28,303
we can turn down the kick drum independently because

89
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,993
it's now on it's own group.

90
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:31,522
And when we turn down the master we can

91
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,156
turn down everything.

92
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:36,156
This is because group A is routed

93
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:39,368
through the master so the master controls

94
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:41,600
everything which is routed through it..

95
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
That's because of the way

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
that the groups are arranged in the groups

97
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,100
area down here.

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,937
We can see that group A is a child 

99
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,599
of the master group and group B is in turn

100
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,406
a child of group A.

101
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:58,406
So if we assign our arpeggio

102
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:01,974
using it's output to group B

103
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,482
we can now test again

104
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:15,255
and we'll see that turning down group A

105
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:16,822
now turns down

106
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,262
both the kick and the arpeggio

107
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:24,053
because group B is a child of group A.

108
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,779
So here we have what's called a

109
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:29,048
serial signal flow routing,

110
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:32,459
meaning group B passes through group A

111
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,653
and then passes through the master.

112
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:38,845
We can also create a parallel signal flow

113
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,105
by changing the routing of group B.

114
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,507
If we click on group B in the groups area

115
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:46,707
and drag it's name on to the master

116
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:48,707
we can now make group B

117
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:52,058
a child of the master and pass it's signal

118
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:55,751
directly to the master, and we can test that out.

119
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:07,327
So now we have the kick in group A.

120
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:10,165
The arpeggio in group B.

121
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,222
And everything being run through the master.

122
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,473
While we're working in the mixer we may want to check

123
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:19,715
parts of our mix individually.

124
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:24,433
We can do this using the solo, mute and bypass

125
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,433
buttons on each of the groups.

126
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,846
When we click solo

127
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:41,651
all the other tracks are temporarily muted

128
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,651
so that we can hear that track by itself

129
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,651
and make any changes we need to make.

130
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:48,536
When we click mute the opposite happens.

131
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:51,161
The one track we've muted becomes silent

132
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,224
and we can hear anything else that we need to hear.

133
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:58,587
Bypass allows us to bypass any

134
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,245
audio effects that we've applied to the channel.

135
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,582
Let's go down and click Add

136
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,608
Low Pass Simple.

137
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,082
This is a low pass filter which will remove

138
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:11,297
high frequencies from our arpeggio sound.

139
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,437
Here's the arpeggio soloed.

140
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:18,568
Here's the bypass.

141
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:21,802
So if we're having problems with one of our effects

142
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:24,598
or we want to check something we can bypass.

143
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,540
It's worth noting that solo, mute and bypass

144
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
are not intended to be used at runtime

145
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
they're supposed to be used in

146
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,458
setting up your mix and designing your sounds.

147
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,458
But not to be controlled by the

148
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,458
engine while the game is playing.

149
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,795
Additionally each group has it's own pitch control.

150
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,636
If we look in the inspector we'll see

151
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:48,924
that the pitch is currently set

152
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:50,367
to 100 for this group,

153
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:51,956
our arpeggio,

154
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:54,400
let's set it to 50%.

155
00:08:08,477 --> 00:08:10,824
So we can adjust the pitch not just

156
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,025
at the individual sound level using

157
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,136
audio source pitch control but also

158
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,789
at the group level.

159
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,789
In addition to controlling signal flow

160
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:22,107
with groups we can also control

161
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:24,300
signal flow with multiple mixers.

162
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,578
By using multiple mixers for each

163
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:28,924
category of sounds in our mix

164
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,924
we can then route those mixers

165
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:33,617
to groups in audio mixer 1

166
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:36,174
to control the overall balance of the mix.

167
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,782
If we create another mixer by

168
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,289
clicking the + button,

169
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,246
we'll call this one

170
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,348
Drum Mixer.

171
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:49,508
We can now create two groups within this.

172
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:52,364
We'll configure this in a

173
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:54,738
 parallel routing

174
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:58,036
and we will assign our kick

175
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:03,027
to the drum mixer kick channel

176
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,714
and we'll activate our percussion source here

177
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:10,291
and assign that to the percussion channel.

178
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,291
In order to be able to control the volume balance

179
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,291
between those two sets of elements let's

180
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,291
create a third group

181
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,329
and route it to the master output.

182
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,685
Now if we grab our drum mixer

183
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,824
and drop it on to audio mixer 1

184
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,647
we can choose drum group as an input.

185
00:09:31,157 --> 00:09:32,580
When we play the scene

186
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:48,136
We can see that our entire drum mixer

187
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:50,980
is now being routed through drum group

188
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:52,875
to the master output.

189
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,750
As you're working in the mixer and your project's

190
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,750
grow more complex you may find

191
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,165
that you want to manage the view of the mixer.

192
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,397
This can be done using the visibility

193
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,717
controls down here, let's say we want to make

194
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:08,318
groups A and B invisible and just view the 

195
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:09,992
drum group and the master,

196
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,053
we can do that by clicking these eye icons

197
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,005
beside the group names.

198
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:18,743
Once we've made them visible we can save that in a view.

199
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,188
Here we currently only have one view,

200
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,538
let's click the + button to make another.

201
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,894
Now in view View Simple we have

202
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,894
these two groups turned off

203
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,310
and in our main view

204
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,807
we could have them turned back on

205
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:35,270
by clicking on the view name we can toggle

206
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,270
between different views of the mixer.

207
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,270
Snapshots allow us to store

208
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,401
and recall the state of the mixer.

209
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:45,747
We'll cover snapshots in their own dedicated lesson.

210
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:48,355
Please see the link below for more information.

211
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,355
So far we've taken a look at

212
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:53,431
controlling our signal flow for our game music.

213
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:55,431
Let's take a look at an example which includes

214
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:57,431
some sound effects as well.

215
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,758
Here we have the Nightmares project

216
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,556
which is available for download on the asset store.

217
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:05,287
What we've done is we've setup two mixers.

218
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:07,469
One is the master mixer and another

219
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:09,594
is a sound effects mixer.

220
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,594
In the master mixer we have two groups,

221
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:15,659
one for music and one for our sound effects.

222
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,958
We've also got our vocal effects

223
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,958
for when the player gets hurt routed

224
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,958
to a vocal effects group also on

225
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,958
the sound effects mixer.

226
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,158
Our background music is routed directly

227
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:30,158
to the music channel of the master mixer

228
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,158
since there's only one channel for the

229
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,620
music in this case.

230
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,171
If we play our scene we can see this in action.

231
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:50,648
Using this approach we can then

232
00:11:50,648 --> 00:11:53,351
balance each separate set of effects,

233
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,706
gun shots, vocal effects

234
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:58,776
against our music easily

235
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:01,141
using one overall volume for sound effects

236
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,857
and one overall volume for music.

1
00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:02,919
Welcome to part 2 of 

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,304
upgrading the Nightmares survival shooter project

3
00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:09,047
from Unity 4 to Unity 5.

4
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:11,773
If you missed part 1 please check that out

5
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,256
before continuing with this video.

6
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:16,256
In this version of the Nightmares project

7
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:18,256
we have a pause menu that's been

8
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:20,256
created with the new UI system.

9
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,852
The pause menu is called up when you press

10
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:26,152
escape using a script called

11
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:29,574
Pause Manager, which is attached to menu canvas.

12
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,132
We'll look at this script in more detail

13
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,634
later in the video.

14
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,634
For more information about creating

15
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:39,142
this type of UI see the information linked below.

16
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:41,142
Before moving on to scripting we want

17
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:43,596
to do one more thing in our mixer.

18
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,911
We want to expose the volume

19
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,829
of the music group and the sound effects group

20
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,255
to script control so that we can set them directly

21
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:54,775
without using the snapshot system.

22
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:56,775
We'll click on the music group,

23
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:59,727
right click on the volume parameter

24
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:02,633
and choose Expose To Script.

25
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,139
We're also going to do this for the sound effects group.

26
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:12,507
Now in our exposed parameters list

27
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:14,710
we're going to name these two parameters.

28
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:18,450
We're going to call our first exposed parameter

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,135
musicVol

30
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,609
and our second

31
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,444
sfxVol.

32
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:27,713
To rename the parameters double click

33
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,713
on the parameter names.

34
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,713
Now that we've got the audio setup

35
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:33,713
in our project we're going to move on

36
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,275
to adding some scripting control.

37
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:39,654
Let's start by editing the pause manager script.

38
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:42,946
We're going to go to the menu canvas game object

39
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,869
and then double click on the pause manager script

40
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,715
to open it in mono develop.

41
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:51,952
Let's just quickly review what we have here.

42
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:53,952
We've added the name space declaration

43
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:56,426
using UnityEngine.UI

44
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,426
because we're using some of the functions

45
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:03,383
from the UI system including the canvas

46
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:04,664
variable type.

47
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,664
We're also checking if we're currently

48
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:08,664
running in the Unity editor

49
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:11,625
and if so we're adding the name space declaration

50
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,625
using Unity editor.

51
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,903
We've declared a variable of the canvas type

52
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:21,021
called Canvas, and this is the UI canvas.

53
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,021
In the start function we're getting a reference

54
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,472
to that using getComponent.

55
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,472
In our update function we're checking

56
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,757
to see if the escape key has been pressed.

57
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,757
If escape has been pressed

58
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:36,656
we'll flip the canvas from enabled to disabled

59
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,463
or visa versa.

60
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:41,417
We'll also call the pause function.

61
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,417
In the pause function we're setting

62
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,611
Time.TimeScale

63
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:48,014
We're doing this by checking if it's currently

64
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:51,011
set to 0, set it to 1

65
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,799
and otherwise set it to 0.

66
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,551
By setting Time.TimeScale to 0

67
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,551
we can freeze the motion of all of

68
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,214
the objects in our game.

69
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,056
We also have a public function called Quit

70
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:05,056
in which we're checking if we're using

71
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,402
the Unity editor we're going to do

72
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:10,921
EditorApplication.isPlaying=false

73
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:13,671
meaning it's going to stop playing the scene.

74
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,901
Or else we're going to call

75
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,199
Application.Quit

76
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,416
meaning if this was the build of our application

77
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,416
it would actually quit out to the desktop.

78
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,416
What we're going to do is we're going to

79
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,416
add some stuff to this script

80
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,588
to allow it to control

81
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,338
our audio mixer.

82
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:32,338
The first thing that we're going to add is another

83
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,761
name space declaration

84
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,503
using UnityEngine.Audio.

85
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:40,220
This is going to allow us to access

86
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,052
members of UnityEngine.Audio including the

87
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:47,988
audio mixer and the audio mixer snapshot classes.

88
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,988
We're going to add 2 public variables

89
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:52,707
of the audio mixer snapshot type.

90
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:55,159
We're going to call these Paused

91
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,531
and Unpaused.

92
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,531
These are going to correspond to the snapshots

93
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,444
that we created in the first video.

94
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:04,565
We're going to add a new public function under Paused.

95
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:08,061
We're going to call this function Lowpass.

96
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,061
In low pass we're going to check if

97
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,116
Time.TimeScale is currently equal to 0.

98
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:16,683
If Time.TimeScale is equal to 0

99
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:19,274
we're going to call the TransitionTo function

100
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,188
from the Paused snapshot.

101
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,477
We're going to parse in a floating point parameter

102
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:25,113
time to reach,

103
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:28,748
in this case 0.01 seconds.

104
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:32,084
If Time.TimeScale does not equal 0

105
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,978
we're going to call TransitionTo from

106
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:36,978
the Unpaused snapshot.

107
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:40,102
With our low pass function declared

108
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,880
we're now going to call it from inside 

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,095
the pause function.

110
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,917
Let's save our script and return to Unity.

111
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:51,686
In the editor we'll see that our

112
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:53,686
pause manager script now has

113
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:57,070
2 new variables, Paused and Unpaused.

114
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,382
We're going to set those to our audio mixer

115
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:03,760
snapshots we created earlier using the asset picker.

116
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:10,054
We'll select the Paused snapshot

117
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,323
and the Unpaused snapshot.

118
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,111
Let's play our scene and give it a try.

119
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:28,062
Press escape and see that the paused snapshot

120
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,450
has been recalled, and then when we click resume

121
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:34,596
we can see that Unpaused has been recalled,

122
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,104
and so we can hear that it's working.

123
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,519
In the Paused menu

124
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,095
we have volume controls for the music

125
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,673
and for the sound effects.

126
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:46,991
We're going to use those to control our audio mixer 

127
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:50,990
using scripting. Let's start by creating a new C# script

128
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,136
which we'll call Mix Levels.

129
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,740
We'll double click it to open it in mono develop.

130
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Again the first thing we're going to start by doing

131
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,740
is adding the name space declaration

132
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,904
using UnityEngine.Audio.

133
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:06,904
Next we're going to add a public variable

134
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:10,352
of the audio mixer type called Master Mixer.

135
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,814
Because we won't need either the update

136
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:16,531
or the start functions we're going to delete those.

137
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:19,637
We're going to declare a public function called

138
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,521
SetSfxLvl.

139
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:24,052
We're going to give SetSfxLvl a

140
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,302
parameter of the type float

141
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,302
called sfxLvl.

142
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,302
We're going to use the sfxLvl

143
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:34,429
parameter to parse a floating point value

144
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:36,477
to master mixer and use

145
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:38,737
that to change the volume

146
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:41,819
of our sound effects level in our audio mixer.

147
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,224
We're going to do this using the SetFloat function.

148
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:48,039
SetFloat takes two parameters.

149
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,039
A string, which is the name

150
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,626
of the exposed parameter that we want to set.

151
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:56,266
And a floating point parameter to set the value.

152
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,682
We're going to parse in the string sfxVol

153
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,499
which is the name of the parameter that we

154
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,499
exposed earlier in the inspector.

155
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:05,128
We're also going to declare a second public function

156
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:06,752
called SetMusicLvl.

157
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,752
SetMusicLvl is also going to take

158
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,571
a floating point parameter, in this case called

159
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:12,822
musicLvl.

160
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:19,849
In SetMusicLvl we're also going to use SetFloat

161
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,609
to set the value of our exposed parameter musicVol.

162
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,049
Let's save our script and return to the editor.

163
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,474
In the editor let's add our

164
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,474
Mix Level script to

165
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:34,743
our menu canvas game object.

166
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:37,580
We're also going to select

167
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,580
our audio mixer master mixer

168
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,724
as the master mixer variable.

169
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,473
Next, in the paused panel

170
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:49,135
we're going to choose our effects

171
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,135
slider game object.

172
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,731
In the slider script you'll see that

173
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,731
previously onValueChanged was

174
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:59,848
changing the value of the gun barrel end

175
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:02,642
and the player audio sources directly.

176
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:06,007
Now we can reconnect those to our audio mixer.

177
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,879
First we're going to drag in our menu canvas.

178
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:13,398
We're going to choose from our list of functions

179
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,398
found on this game object

180
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:17,398
our mix level script

181
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,187
and we're going to choose the SetSfxLvl function

182
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:22,842
from that script.

183
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:24,842
We can remove the connection to the player audio

184
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:27,955
source by selecting it and hitting -.

185
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,827
We're going to do the same thing for our music slider.

186
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:39,734
Drag in our menu canvas game object.

187
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:43,388
Choose from our list of functions, in this case

188
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:46,083
mix levels, set music level.

189
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,975
Because we determined that -10

190
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,975
decibels was probably the loudest

191
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:52,975
we wanted our music to be in the mixer

192
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:56,133
we're going to set that in the max value in the slider.

193
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,623
We're also going to set the minimum value

194
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:04,085
to -80, which will be silent.

195
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,852
In the effects slider we're going to do the same thing

196
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,158
except it's going to be between -80

197
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:16,727
and 0.

198
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:20,750
With that setup let's play our scene

199
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,912
and give it a try.

200
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,099
We'll hit escape,

201
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:28,049
adjust the music volume,.

202
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,568
Let's pull down the sound effects volume too.

203
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:36,996
So there we have it.

204
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,662

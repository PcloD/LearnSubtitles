1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:02,389
In this assignment we're going to look at taking

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:05,871
a project created in Unity 4, in this case

3
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:07,871
the Nightmares project which is available

4
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,871
as a free download in the asset store

5
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,208
and upgrading it to Unity 5.

6
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:14,918
We're going to focus on the audio capability

7
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:18,913
of Unity 5, including using audio mixers

8
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:20,729
and audio effects.

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,729
To upgrade the project we're going to focus

10
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:24,228
on three areas.

11
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:26,228
We're going to create two audio mixers

12
00:00:26,228 --> 00:00:28,228
and route all of our audio sources

13
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,228
to groups in those mixers.

14
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,661
We're going to setup some effects processing

15
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,758
to shape the mix at run time

16
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:36,758
and we're also going to look at how to control our

17
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:39,257
mixer at run time using scripting.

18
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:41,527
We're going to cover this in two videos.

19
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:43,527
In this video we'll look at signal flow

20
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,432
with the audio mixer and using audio effects

21
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:47,755
in your mix.

22
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:50,997
Let's begin by creating some new

23
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:54,033
audio mixer assets which we'll use

24
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,033
to manage the audio signal flow

25
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,366
in our project.

26
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,366
We'll highlight our Audio folder,

27
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:01,751
go to the Create menu and choose

28
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,443
Audio Mixer.

29
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,280
We'll call this first mixer Master Mixer

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
and we're going to make a second mixer

31
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:12,222
called Sound Effects.

32
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:15,635
Next we'll open our audio mixer window

33
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,635
under Window - Audio Mixer.

34
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:21,613
You can also choose command-8 on mac

35
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:23,613
or control-8 on PC.

36
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:26,611
I've docked my audio mixer at the bottom of the screen.

37
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,457
Let's give it a little bit more screen real estate.

38
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:33,125
We're currently looking at the sound effects mixer.

39
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,125
To look at the master mixer we can click

40
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,587
it's name in the mixers list below.

41
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:40,174
Master mixer has only one group,

42
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:41,487
the master.

43
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:43,487
We're going to add some groups so that we can

44
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:46,369
route in our sound effects mixer

45
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:47,785
and our music.

46
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:50,936
Let's create some new groups in master mixer.

47
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:53,080
We'll highlight the master group,

48
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,244
click the + button,

49
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:57,244
and then highlight it again so that the

50
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:59,804
second group is created as a child

51
00:01:59,804 --> 00:02:01,111
of the master.

52
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:03,885
We can click on these names to rename them.

53
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:06,532
Now our music group is only going to

54
00:02:06,532 --> 00:02:09,088
contain a single signal, the output from

55
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:11,088
the audio source on our background music

56
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:13,701
object which loops our background music.

57
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,701
Our sound effects group is going to contain

58
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,161
multiple audio signals coming from

59
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,872
different game objects and we may want to control

60
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:22,872
the levels of those independently.

61
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:25,084
This is why we're created the sound effects mixer.

62
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,084
and what we want to do now is

63
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,084
route the output of the entire

64
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:31,084
sound effects mixer in to the

65
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,889
sound effects group of master mixer.

66
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,889
We'll do this by dragging the sound effects

67
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,130
mixer on to master mixer

68
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,553
and then selecting the group that we want to route

69
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:42,553
that mixer's output in to,

70
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,785
in this case Sound Effects.

71
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,810
Now we can see that sound effects has become

72
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,139
a child of master mixer

73
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:53,282
and we'll route it's output

74
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:56,394
in to the sound effects group of master mixer.

75
00:02:57,134 --> 00:03:00,426
In sound effects we're going to create some new groups as well.

76
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,782
We'll call these Player,

77
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,454
Enemies and Gun Shots.

78
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:13,237
Notice that since gun shots was created with the enemies

79
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:16,086
group highlighted it's been made a child of enemies.

80
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,528
We're going to want to make that a child of the 

81
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,528
master so that it's signal will flow

82
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,528
directly in to the master group

83
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:25,951
and then in to the sound effects group of master mixer.

84
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,951
With our groups created it's time to

85
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,250
route the outputs of our audio sources

86
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,250
to the groups that we've made.

87
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,250
Let's start with the player.

88
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:38,883
The player has an audio source

89
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,883
on Gun Barrel End

90
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:44,153
which is currently routed directly

91
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,379
to the audio listener in the scene.

92
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:48,824
We're going to go ahead and choose

93
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,496
a new output for that, in this case

94
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:54,824
the gun shots group of our sound effects mixer.

95
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,795
On the parent player game object

96
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,795
we have another audio source

97
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:03,141
which plays the player vocalisation sound effects.

98
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,797
We're going to go ahead and select the output for that

99
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,185
and route that to the player group

100
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,049
of our sound effects mixer.

101
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,217
After making those changes to the player object

102
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:18,002
let's make sure that we hit Apply

103
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:20,002
to save them to the player prefab.

104
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,613
We're also going to configure the output routing

105
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:25,767
for our enemy prefabs.

106
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,230
To do this we're going to go to the

107
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,230
Completed Assets folder

108
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,862
Prefabs

109
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:35,259
and we'll start with our Helephant prefab.

110
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,140
We'll scroll down,

111
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,777
select the output of the Helephant audio source

112
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,893
and choose the Enemies group of our

113
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,893
sound effects mixer.

114
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,164
We'll do the same for our Zombear,

115
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,910
and our Zombunnie

116
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:00,998
prefabs.

117
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,388
The only remaining audio source that we need

118
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,869
to assign is our background music.

119
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,592
Select the background music game object in the scene

120
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:13,526
and on the audio source we'll choose the output

121
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:17,105
and assign it directly to the music group

122
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,105
of master mixer.

123
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:21,621
With our audio sources now routed

124
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,621
in to our new audio mixers

125
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:26,835
we're going to add some effects processing.

126
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,835
Let's open the audio mixer

127
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,615
and we're going to select master mixer

128
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,615
and on the Music group we're going to

129
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:35,615
choose Add

130
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:39,773
low pass simple.

131
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:44,094
Low pass simple is a low pass filter

132
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,394
which attenuates frequencies

133
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:48,649
above the cutoff frequency,

134
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:50,478
making them quieter.

135
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:52,478
Let's test our scene and hear how the low

136
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,912
pass filter sounds.

137
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,927
So as we pull the cutoff down we can hear the high

138
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,927
frequencies are attenuated.

139
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:11,279
As you can hear, the music is still a little

140
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,279
loud over the sound effects.

141
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,279
The first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to

142
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,898
pull the volume down, I think to about -10 decibels.

143
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,345
The next thing that we're going to do is we're going to

144
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:23,345
add a little bit of dynamic volume

145
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:25,345
control using the the duck 

146
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,345
volume audio effect.

147
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,492
We're going to go ahead and click Add on the music group.

148
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:32,890
select Duck Volume.

149
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,461
And now what we need to do is we need to

150
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,301
route some signal from the group

151
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,301
that we want to cause our

152
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,301
music to duck in volume.

153
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,573
We're going to use the sound effects group so

154
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:46,573
that when the sound effects play the music

155
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,235
will automatically get quieter.

156
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,779
In order for the duck volume effect to be able to

157
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,779
receive signal from the sound effects

158
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,408
group we're going to need to use a send audio effect.

159
00:06:57,738 --> 00:07:00,139
On the sound effects group we're going to click Add

160
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,176
and choose Send.

161
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,176
The send effect allows us to duplicate

162
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:07,389
our audio signal and route it elsewhere

163
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:08,960
in the audio mixer.

164
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,044
In this case we're going to route it to our

165
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:13,796
duck volume effect by choosing

166
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,530
Music - Duck Volume

167
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,232
from the Bus menu of the send.

168
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,911
With the bus selected we're going to turn up

169
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,911
the send level all the way.

170
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,911
This is how loud the duplicate

171
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,520
signal is going to be, which is being

172
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
routed to the duck volume effect.

173
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
In this case this won't add

174
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,739
any audible level to our project

175
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,739
because we're using the side chain input

176
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,648
of the duck volume

177
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,775
only as a control signal.

178
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,775
With our send and our duck volume effects

179
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:48,110
setup let's play the scene and test again.

180
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,675
We can see that the volume that's being received

181
00:07:58,675 --> 00:08:00,675
is not exceeding the threshold

182
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,310
of the duck volume effect..

183
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,310
The duck volume effect will not actually 

184
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,310
begin to lower the volume of the music until the

185
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,310
threshold is exceeded.

186
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,310
Let's play the scene and experiment with

187
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,764
the threshold value.

188
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,764
What we want is for the threshold to be

189
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:15,764
low enough that the sound effects will

190
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,764
cause the duck volume to begin turning

191
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,173
down the music when the sound effects play.

192
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,318
Edit In Play Mode.

193
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,962
So we've arrived at the sort of -34 value

194
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,962
which sounds pretty good because when

195
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,962
our sound effects are playing we could hear

196
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,962
that the music is getting reduced

197
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,962
and then that effect is that our

198
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,962
sound effects feel a little bit louder

199
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,962
and more present but we haven't had to

200
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,849
sacrifice music volume overall

201
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,849
in order to do that.

202
00:08:56,849 --> 00:08:59,622
For detailed information about duck volume

203
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,882
and send effects see the information linked below.

204
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,599
With our two mixers and our audio effects

205
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,599
setup it's time to prepare them

206
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,889
for script control at run time.

207
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,597
The first thing that we're going to do is to create

208
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,597
two audio mixer snapshots

209
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,597
which are going to control the state

210
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,816
of the mixer and allow us to recall

211
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:21,606
different mixer states, including levels

212
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:23,090
and effects settings.

213
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,090
We're going to start by creating

214
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,570
a new audio mixer snapshot

215
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,570
by clicking the + button

216
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,570
in the snapshots area.

217
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,570
We'll call that one Paused and we'll

218
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,361
name our first snapshot

219
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:37,468
Unpaused.

220
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,468
Both of these snapshots will be saved to the

221
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:42,095
master mixer because that's where they were created.

222
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,703
In the Unpaused snapshot we'll keep out

223
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,259
mixer settings the same.

224
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,831
In the Paused snapshot we're going to change the

225
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:50,831
value of the low pass simple effect

226
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,831
and pull the filter cutoff down.

227
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:56,502
Let's say to 365hz.

228
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:58,502
We can test quickly how that sounds.

229
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:01,622
Edit In Play Mode.

230
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:05,507
And recall the Paused snapshot by clicking on it.


231
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,441
Now that we've got our project setup

232
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,277
we're going to end part 1.

233
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:18,444
In part 2 we'll look at controlling the mix via scripting.

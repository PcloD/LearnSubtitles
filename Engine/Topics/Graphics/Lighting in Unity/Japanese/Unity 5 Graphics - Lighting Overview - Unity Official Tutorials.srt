1
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:06,218
Lighting in Unity is more fully featured than ever.

2
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:11,786
The lighting pipeline includes realtime global illumination,

3
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:15,109
in addition to traditional baked light mapping techniques.

4
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,710
These combined with physically-based rendering

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,297
and the standard shader

6
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:25,421
give more power and versatility to light more complex scenes.

7
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:32,688
Unity uses physically-based rendering, or PBR

8
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:35,699
to create a friendly way of achieving a consistent

9
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:39,956
plausible look for materials under all lighting conditions.

10
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:44,764
In order to do so, Unity models how light actually behaves

11
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:46,764
and follows the laws of physics on how

12
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:48,764
light interacts with materials.

13
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:53,704
These materials are usually created using the standard shader.

14
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:55,704
The standard shader makes physically

15
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:58,749
based rendering easy and accessible to use.

16
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,322
One of the most powerful tools in the Unity

17
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:07,195
pipeline is Unity's realtime global illumination,

18
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:08,948
or GI.

19
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:12,404
Using GI, all lights in the scene can effect

20
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:14,923
the object's within range with both

21
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,928
direct and indirect illumination.

22
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:19,928
Direct illumination comes from lights

23
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:23,564
shining directly on the objects in the scene.

24
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:25,564
Indirect illumination however

25
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:28,780
is the light reflected, or bounced off of

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,780
the light surfaces in the scene.

27
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:33,364
This bounced indirect light

28
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:35,364
can illuminate nearby objects

29
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:38,694
mimicking how light behaves in the real world

30
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,694
This indirect light is effected

31
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:43,551
by the colour of the surfaces it bounces off of,

32
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:47,375
taking a contribution of that surface's colour with it.

33
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,375
Direct and indirect light will

34
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,971
blend together to create a much more realistic look.

35
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,368
In addition to the default main camera

36
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,368
a new scene in Unity comes with

37
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:02,368
a default sky box

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,368
and a default directional light aligned

39
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,368
with that sky box.

40
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,609
Each scene also contains default

41
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,609
values for ambient light.

42
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:17,974
Ambient light illuminates all surfaces in the scene.

43
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:22,015
Ambient light is controlled by the settings in the

44
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,523
lighting panels Environment Lighting tab.

45
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,783
Ambient light can be created by either

46
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,783
using a sky box,

47
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,917
a user generated gradient of 3 colours,

48
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,208
or a single colour.

49
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:56,593
All objects added to the scene

50
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,499
will receive ambient light

51
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:01,881
unless the ambient intensity value is set to 0

52
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:06,265
or the ambient light's colour values are set to black.

53
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,093
It is rare, if not impossible

54
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:12,093
for any real-world material

55
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:15,638
to have absolutely no reflectivity.

56
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:18,676
By default all objects in the scene

57
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:21,433
will also receive reflection information.

58
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:25,630
Even though the cube, sphere and plane in the scene

59
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,970
are unlit and ambient light is none

60
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,970
they still receive lighting information

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,631
in the form of reflections.

62
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:37,015
The default reflection source is the sky box.

63
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:40,034
This can be changed to a custom cube map.

64
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,352
To receive no default reflections

65
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,352
either set the custom cube map to none,

66
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:49,084
or remove the sky box.

67
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,024
It is worth noting that the default sky box

68
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,494
is procedurally generated

69
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:58,494
and new procedural sky boxes

70
00:03:58,494 --> 00:04:00,494
can be created and saved as assets.

71
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,646
When lighting scenes in Unity

72
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,646
we can work with realtime lighting,

73
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,881
baked lighting,

74
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,053
or a mixture of both.

75
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:26,129
Realtime lighting is more easily modified at run time.

76
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:28,129
but it comes at a cost to performance.

77
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:31,562
Baked lighting on the other hand pre-calculates

78
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,004
much more detailed lighting information

79
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,961
and saves it to a light mapped texture on disc.

80
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,470
This light map information is then

81
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,470
read from the texture at run time,

82
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,470
avoiding the need to do any lighting

83
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,470
calculations when the project is running.

84
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,450
This saves performance,

85
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,846
but at the cost of dynamic changes in the scene.

86
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:54,722
Baked light maps are not updated at run time.

87
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,975
Lights can be switched between realtime, baked,

88
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,975
and mixed lighting on a per-light basis.

89
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,256
Using baked lighting exclusively

90
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:07,020
would be more appropriate for target platforms

91
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,844
such as mobile devices with lower performance capabilities.

92
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:16,011
The light mapping system can either work

93
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,011
continuously or on demand.

94
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:22,081
When continuous baking is selected

95
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,019
lighting changes will be baked in the background while editing.

96
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,754
These changes can either be properties

97
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:29,242
adjusted in the inspector,

98
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:31,926
or objects changed in the scene.

99
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,343
When continuous baking is not selected

100
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,686
changes will only preview on demand.

101
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:53,426
When the Build button in the lighting panel has been selected.

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
In this scene there is a directional light

103
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,004
coming in through the skylight in the ceiling.

104
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:09,488
This light contributes to the illumination of the entire scene

105
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,488
as the light bounces off of the surfaces

106
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,127
it lights directly,

107
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,096
on to other nearby surfaces in an indirect manner.

108
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,445
This light continues to indirectly

109
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,445
illuminate nearby surfaces

110
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,445
until the strength of the light fades

111
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:24,993
and it can bounce no more.

112
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,594
Decrease the intensity of the light

113
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:31,132
and the illumination of the scene decreases accordingly.

114
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,693
Likewise, if the directional light

115
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,693
is rotated to directly light a

116
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,562
different part of the scene,

117
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:43,349
it will now illuminate the scene in a different way,

118
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,971
with both it's direct and indirect lighting.

119
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:51,948
As materials created with a standard shader

120
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:55,297
can mimic a wide variety of physical surfaces

121
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:57,297
and different materials can have different

122
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:59,030
amounts of reflectivity

123
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,030
this can effect the scene's lighting.

124
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,475
To help balance this the Bounce Intensity can be adjusted

125
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,832
on either a per-light basis

126
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,832
or globally by adjusting the settings

127
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:11,832
in the lighting panel.

128
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:15,338
Adjustments can be made here to artificially

129
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:18,705
change the potential bounce of light from a lit surface.

130
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,307
Adjust the mount of indirect light

131
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,307
in the scene, and more.

132
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:28,982
In addition to lights we can use

133
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,328
emissive surfaces to contribute to the scene's lighting.

134
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,421
This scene is lit with a variety of lights

135
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,297
and light types, including emissive surfaces.

136
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:42,550
Emissive surfaces are a light source, 

137
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,836
but they behave very much like indirect bounced light.

138
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:48,836
The primary emissive surfaces in the scene

139
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,836
are in the main corridor junction.

140
00:07:51,194 --> 00:07:54,044
But additional panels are located throughout the scene.

141
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,644
All of these emissive surfaces use

142
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,872
the standard shader's Emission property

143
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,255
by adjusting the Emissive scale.

144
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,382
The float value next to the Emission property

145
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,229
and by adding a touch of colour,

146
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,229
the mood of our scene changes.

147
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:16,996
As these lights can participate in realtime light mapping

148
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,996
they can be controlled at runtime using

149
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:20,996
code or animation to create

150
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,996
complex changes in mood

151
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,996
while our projects are running.

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
The final contributing factor in lighting

153
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
a Unity scene are probes.

154
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,822
There are 2 types of probes in Unity.

155
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,931
Light probes

156
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,915
and reflection probes.

157
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,121
Light probes sample the lighting in the scene

158
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:45,121
at different positions in the world.

159
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:49,568
The information in these probes can be used

160
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,568
to light dynamic elements in the scene

161
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:55,912
such as characters or other moving objects

162
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:57,912
at a low cost to performance.

163
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,492
Reflection probes on the other hand

164
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:06,492
act as a single point of reference to

165
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,492
calculate reflections from

166
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,114
Surrounding each reflection probes

167
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:13,114
is a cuboid that specifies

168
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:15,618
what should be included in that reflection.

169
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,840
These probes sample the elements surrounding them

170
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
using box projection,

171
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
and store that information in a cube map.

172
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,779
Materials with reflective surfaces

173
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,656
that are on objects within the reflection probe's volume

174
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,656
can then reference this cube map to

175
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,352
create reflective surfaces.

176
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,939
By default there is one built-in

177
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:41,070
reflection probe in every scene.

178
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,070
This default reflection probe

179
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,486
reflects the sky box to create basic reflections.

180
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,486
For more detail in the reflections

181
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,486
additional reflection probes

182
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,486
should be added and positioned appropriately

183
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,486
for the reflective objects.

184
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:59,919
It is worth noting that phyically-based rendering

185
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,919
works best in linear colour space.

186
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,484
Linear colour space will give

187
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:07,621
a more realistic and mathematically correct result.

188
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,788
For best results make sure that

189
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,788
the colour space is set to linear

190
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:15,788
in the project's

191
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,788
Player Settings window.

192
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,065
Linear colour space is the default setting.

193
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:24,988
Be aware that not all platforms 

194
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:26,988
support linear colour space however,

195
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:28,988
and that gamma is currently the

196
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,964
required colour space for most mobile platforms,.

197
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
When looking at all these aspects

198
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
to lighting a scene in Unity

199
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,906
they can be summed up effectively

200
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:44,210
with the main contributory factors.

201
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,914
Ambient light.

202
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,762
Reflections.

203
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:52,762
And light sources.

204
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:55,271
Working with materials created

205
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,271
with the standard shader being

206
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:00,182
drawn using phyically-based rendering

207
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:02,182
with global illumination to calculate

208
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,182
the indirect light and create

209
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:07,308
more complex, more realistic scenes.

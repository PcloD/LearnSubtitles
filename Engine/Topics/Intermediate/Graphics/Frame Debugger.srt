1
00:00:01,137 --> 00:00:04,006
In Unity rendering a frame to the screen

2
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,811
occurs in a linear sequence of events.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,029
The Frame Debugger is a tool which lets

4
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:13,654
you see all the steps involved

5
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:16,545
in rendering a frame step by step.

6
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:20,154
It allows you to the see intermediate render targets,

7
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,942
shadow maps and each draw call

8
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:25,686
that contributes to the frame, in order.

9
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,856
The frame debugger is accessed from

10
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,856
Window - Frame Debugger.

11
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,749
The editor will pause and in the frame debug window

12
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:47,737
a sequential list of each step involved

13
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:50,840
in current frame will displayed.

14
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,936
Many of these are draw called.

15
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:57,369
But they also involve other render related events

16
00:00:57,369 --> 00:00:58,867
like frame buffer clears,

17
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:01,477
which set the initial colours of the screen,

18
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,905
or compute shader invocation.

19
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:07,852
A draw call is a command in which the CPU

20
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:11,066
sends content to be rendered, like meshes,

21
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:14,959
to the GPU to be rendered as pixels for display.

22
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:18,013
At the top of the window are two

23
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:20,013
forward and back buttons

24
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:24,976
along with a slider, which will allow you to step through this list in order.

25
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:53,035
Selecting a single step in the process from the main list

26
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,987
will cause that draw call or event,

27
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:57,987
along with the steps prior to it,

28
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,987
to be drawn in the game view.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,667
If that step is drawing a mesh renderer

30
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,406
the game object with that mesh renderer attached

31
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:08,406
will be highlighted in the hierarchy.

32
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,790
Viewing a step in the main list allows

33
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,790
you to see where in the overall

34
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,790
process of drawing the frame it occurs.

35
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,137
Related steps are grouped together

36
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:23,228
and their views can be expanded or collapsed.

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,102
Analysing frames in this way is useful

38
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:30,322
to learn precisely how and in what order

39
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:32,322
Unity is rendering your frame.

40
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:39,052
When setting up a new project we

41
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:41,858
can choose between 4 different render paths.

42
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,301
Each render path renders content differently.

43
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,105
Choosing which to use is highly 

44
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:50,105
dependent on the nature of your project.

45
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,129
To choose a render path for your project

46
00:02:54,129 --> 00:03:00,069
navigate to Edit - Project Settings - Player

47
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:07,873
and select a rendering path from the drop-down

48
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:09,873
under Other Settings.

49
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,727
For more information about the available

50
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:19,673
render paths please see the information linked below.

51
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,727
Each render path can use a different

52
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:25,660
number of render targets.

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,660
A render target is a feature of

54
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,660
GPUs that allow a scene

55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,623
to be rendered to an intermediate memory buffer.

56
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:36,497
Using the for Forward rendering path

57
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:39,374
1 render target is used by default.

58
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,483
Here shown as RT0,

59
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,483
along with a depth buffer.

60
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,495
Using customer shaders it's possible

61
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,497
to use more render targets in forward rendering

62
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,497
but using the standard shader this is

63
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:56,497
the default behaviour.

64
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:01,679
This project is in differed rendering mode.

65
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:06,002
In differed rendering mode multiple render targets are used.

66
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:08,560
When rendering to multiple targets at once

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,219
you can select which display using the drop down menu.

68
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:16,371
In this example we can see the diffuse,

69
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,508
specular,

70
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:23,547
normals,

71
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,950
and emission and indirect lighting buffers

72
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,644
in in Unity 5 differed shading mode

73
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:33,644
using the standard shader.

74
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,656
You can also see the depth buffer by

75
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,656
selecting it from the same drop down.

76
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,510
When an event is highlighted

77
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,510
information will be displayed about that event

78
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,510
in the information panel.

79
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,784
In the case of draw calls the information

80
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:55,784
panel also includes buttons which will

81
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:59,344
allow you to isolate and visualise information,

82
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:01,344
including the red, 

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,173
green,

84
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:08,165
blue and alpha channels

85
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,165
of the selected render target.

86
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:13,455
You can also adjust the brightness of the

87
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:17,124
display using the levels bracketed slider here.

88
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,929
This can be useful in HDR rendering

89
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,929
to isolate certain luminance ranges

90
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:26,783
of a frame for analysis.

Here's a quick Unity tip.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,200
When you're working in Unity and you want to find a game object in the Hierarchy

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,380
With a specific component or script attached

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:20,280
You can type the Full Case Sensitive Name in the Hierarchy search

5
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:27,345
Notice that the object will not appear until the full name has been completed

6
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:31,984
Here we can see that we've found our game object 'Player'

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
Which has the dummy script 'FindMe' attached

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:49,920
You can also use this technique to find attached Unity components - in this case, the Animator

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,714
As we can see, the Player object also has an Animator component attached

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,040
Which we have found, by searching in the Hierarchy for it's name

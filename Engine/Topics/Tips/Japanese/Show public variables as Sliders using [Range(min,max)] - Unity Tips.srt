00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,635
A quick tip for Unity.

2
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,635
If you're working with public variables that are

3
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05,483
exposed in the inspector,

4
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:08,426
such as this Speed variable in our PlayerMovement script,

5
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,426
you may wish to turn them in to a slider

6
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:13,823
instead of simply a float value that you can type in to.

7
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:15,823
You can do this very easily.

8
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,823
In your script simply place above the

9
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:21,161
public variable range declaration

10
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:22,784
which looks like this;

11
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,693
Open square brackets and type Range,

12
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,693
and then in to normal brackets type in

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,500
the two float values that you'd like the slider to go to and from.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,750
So for example with my player's speed

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,234
I might want to have a minimum value of  1

16
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,234
and a maximum value of 10.

17
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,789
That way I can limit any kind of

18
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:42,998
game designer that plays around with this script

19
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:46,071
from going over the potential maximum value.

20
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:48,789
I save my script and switch back.

21
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:51,968
And as soon as the script compiles I now have a slider

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,968
to play around with the speed.

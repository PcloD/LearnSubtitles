A quick tip for finding assets for your game

2
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:06,010
is to use the project panel to search the assets store.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,010
So if you're looking through your project thinking

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,333
'I don't really have the assets that I need'

5
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,542
for example I might search for 'zombie'

6
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,542
when I've only really got some zombears.

7
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:17,714
Then we can just simply use the toggle

8
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:18,914
below the search field.

9
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:21,152
So you'll see Search, it'll say Assets.

10
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:23,821
If you flip this to Asset Store

11
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,721
and then search for what you want, for example Zombie.

12
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:29,108
You'll find all of the results on the store

13
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:31,840
and you can select them, you can

14
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,701
move your preview, you can have a look around them,

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,382
you can import that package, you ca do all that kind of stuff.

16
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:39,382
So it's a quick way to browse the assets store without

17
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:42,123
opening the store and looking through the categories there.

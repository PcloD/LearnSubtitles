00:00:00,486 --> 00:00:02,116
A quick tip for Unity.

2
00:00:02,116 --> 00:00:03,879
When looking for documentation

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,879
you'll find a link in the form of a book icon

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,368
with a question mark on it

5
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:09,285
to the right of each component.

6
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,285
Clicking this will take you to the locally installed

7
00:00:11,285 --> 00:00:13,285
documentation for that component.

8
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:21,284
Note that when dealing with script components

9
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:23,830
you'll be taken to the script reference definition

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,830
for mono behaviour.

11
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,261
This will allow you to then backtrack and look at

12
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,817
some of the functions that might be used in your script.

13
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:38,668
Otherwise you'll simply get the reference for that component.

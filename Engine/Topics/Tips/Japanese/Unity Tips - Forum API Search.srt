A quick tip for Unity.

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,229
If you're using the forums to

3
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,594
read C# formatted code

4
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:07,594
you can click on any of the API elements to

5
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:11,075
actually visit the script reference search for that term.

6
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:13,075
So for example if I click on Input,

7
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:16,852
the scripting API will perform a search

8
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:18,533
for that and I can jump to any of the

9
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,533
relevant properties of that.

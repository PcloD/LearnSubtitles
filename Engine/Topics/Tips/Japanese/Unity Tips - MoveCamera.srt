A quick tip for positioning cameras in Unity.

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:05,175
So it can be painful to select cameras

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:07,175
and use the transform controls to

4
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:08,635
kind of move them around.

5
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:10,635
It's much easier to actually use the

6
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,555
scene view camera to get the actual

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,387
frame that you want with the camera

8
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:17,387
and then move the camera to that position.

9
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:20,851
For example I can move my scene view camera around

10
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,851
like this, I could use right-click,

11
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:25,626
and look around and then use the

12
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,626
cursor keys to kind of move that around,

13
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,390
get the exact shot that I want,

14
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:33,418
then select the camera

15
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:35,418
and go to Game Object

16
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,224
Align With View.

17
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:44,094
That then puts the camera exactly where you want it.

18
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:46,094
You've also got the ability to jump the scene

19
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:48,094
view camera back to that position if you've

20
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:50,919
left it and you want to kind of re-evaluate.

21
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:54,630
You can go back to Game Object - Align View To Selected.

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,630
That will take you back.

23
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,630
So remember, get the scene view camera to where

24
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,224
you want it, command-shift-F or control-shift-F,

25
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:05,349
to reposition it.

26
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:11,617
Or if you want to go back and start reevaluating

27
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:14,992
if you've moved away use Align View To Selected.

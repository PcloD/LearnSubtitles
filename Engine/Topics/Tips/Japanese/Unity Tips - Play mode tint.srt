A quick Unity tip.

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:03,080
When you're working in the editor

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,080
it's easy to forget that you're in play mode,

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
and what can happen is that when you're

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,010
adjusting values of game objects,

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,047
when you leave play mode those settings can be forgotten.

7
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:14,727
So it's quite useful to be able to remind yourself

8
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:18,365
of being in play mode, and you can do this using tinting.

9
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:20,822
So if you go to Unity Preferences on Mac,

10
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,822
or Edit Preferences on PC

11
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,822
you can go to the Colours section

12
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:27,200
and in there you'll find Playmode tint.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Simply set this to a colour that's kind of

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,488
obvious and will stick out

15
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,488
and then the editor will entirely tint

16
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,488
to this colour when you're in play mode

17
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,488
to remind you. It looks like this.

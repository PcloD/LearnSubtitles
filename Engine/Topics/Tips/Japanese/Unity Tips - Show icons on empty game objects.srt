Here's a quick tip for Unity.

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:13,069
In Unity, its common to use empty game objects for spawn points, and other invisible objects in our scene

3
00:00:13,069 --> 00:00:21,249
Here we have an empty game object called Spawn Point which currently only has a Transform component

4
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:25,716
When we have the object highlighted in the Hierarchy, it's easy to see.

5
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:29,844
but when we deselect it, it becomes completely invisible

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,400
to solve this, we can assign our empty game object a custom icon

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,960
the icon menu is in the upper left corner of the Inspector

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,240
by click on it, we can choose a panel icon

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,640
which will show the object's name against a coloured panel

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,560
we can choose a small circular icon of various colours

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,120
a diamond

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,840
or we can click Other to choose a custom icon

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,140
Here I will assign the default particle texture as the icon

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,000
Now when we deselect the object

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,280
we can see that the icon causes it to remain visible

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,640
these icons will not be visible in the Game view, unless the 'Gizmos' toggle is turned on

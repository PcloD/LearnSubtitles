00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:02,500
Here's a quick tip for moving objects

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
around by defined increments.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:06,792
So you can snap objects by holding

4
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:09,278
command on Mac or control on PC,

5
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,125
and they'll move in defined increments.

6
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,923
For example if I drag this now holding the command key

7
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:15,923
I can move it around.

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,415
You can set these increments by going to Edit

9
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:25,212
Snap Settings and define how many units you want things to move by

10
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,212
And you can see from this panel that the same goes

11
00:00:27,212 --> 00:00:29,212
for scaling and rotation.

12
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,128
Holding command will move

13
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:33,715
those defined amount of degrees at a time.

14
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:39,462
If you want to snap by vertex

15
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:41,126
you can hold down the V key

16
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:45,021
and then drag a particular vertex of your model

17
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,021
to a vertex on the environment.

18
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,715
This is more useful when snapping together

19
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,715
modular parts of an environment.

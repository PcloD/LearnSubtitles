A quick tip for Unity.

2
00:00:01,764 --> 00:00:04,375
If you're working with the inspector to preview

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:07,611
any kind of assets like models, wave forms,

4
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:09,000
anything that you can import,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you're using the preview window quite often

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,665
it can be helpful to pop it out and view it larger.

7
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,665
For example, with this animation clip,

8
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:18,141
I can simply right-click on the header bar

9
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:20,141
of the preview window to pop it out

10
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,141
in to a larger window that I can move to another screen

11
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:24,141
or dock wherever I wish.

12
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:27,044
Close the window to dock it back.

13
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,697
Right-click the top bar of the preview

14
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,254
and it pops out, close to return it.

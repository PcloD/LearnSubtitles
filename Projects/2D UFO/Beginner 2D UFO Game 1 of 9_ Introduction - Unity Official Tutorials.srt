1
00:00:03,606 --> 00:00:05,573
In this beginner assignment we're going to make a

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,064
very simple but playable 2D game

3
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:10,064
to use many of the basic concepts

4
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:12,064
from the beginner tutorial modules.

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,369
We'll be making a 2D UFO game

6
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,940
where we'll be collecting gold nuggets.

7
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:20,629
We'll see how to create new game objects,

8
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,893
add components to these game objects,

9
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:25,664
set the values on their properties,

10
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:27,955
and position these game objects in the scene

11
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,955
to create a game.

12
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:32,718
In our game the player will control

13
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:34,718
a UFO flying around the game board in a

14
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,606
top-down 2D view.

15
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:39,423
We'll move the UFO using physics and forces.

16
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:41,423
We'll look at the input from the player

17
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:43,423
through the keyboard and we'll use those inputs

18
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:44,976
to apply forces to the UFO,

19
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,976
making it move in our scene.

20
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,628
We'll see how to detect contact between

21
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:52,293
the UFO and the pickup game objects

22
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:54,600
and use these events to collect

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,323
the pickup game objects.

24
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,919
When we've done we'll have made a simple

25
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,919
UFO game where the player controls the

26
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,390
UFO with the keyboard, picks up and counts

27
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,390
special collectable objects,

28
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,390
displays the current count,

29
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,725
and ends the game when all of the

30
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,725
game objects have been picked up.

31
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:15,043
To complete this project we'll use custom

32
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:17,043
created 2D art assets

33
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,043
which can be downloaded from the 

34
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:21,043
Unity Asset Store.

35
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:23,854
Let's begin by creating a new project.

36
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,866
First open the Unity editor

37
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:28,866
if you haven't done that already.

38
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,866
You can create a new project by

39
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,847
choosing File - New Project.

40
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,357
This will bring us to the home screen.

41
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,369
On the home screen you can create a

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,369
new project either by hitting the

43
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,369
blue Create New Project button

44
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,369
in the centre of the window,

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,369
or by clicking the New button

46
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,369
at the top of the window.

47
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,103
The first thing that we need to do is

48
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:56,367
to give our project a name, 

49
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,896
I'm going to call the project UFO Game.

50
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:03,753
The next thing we need to do is set the

51
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:05,753
destination, or path, to our new project.

52
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,839
I'm going to put this new project on my desktop.

53
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:18,922
You'll see we have a choice

54
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:20,922
to set the project preferences

55
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:24,004
to either 3D or 2D mode.

56
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:25,797
Since we're working in 2D

57
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,797
I'm going to click 2D.

58
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:32,352
This will set the preferences for the Unity editor

59
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,488
to useful defaults for creating 2D game.s

60
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,614
For more information on working in 2D,

61
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,614
please see the information linked below.

62
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,067
Now click the Create Project button

63
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,067
to create our new project.

64
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,816
Unity will create a new empty scene

65
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,816
for us to work in.

66
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,371
The first thing we'll need to do is to download

67
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,371
and import our art assets

68
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:00,566
from the Unity Asset Store.

69
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:03,009
To access the Asset Store choose

70
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,732
Window - Asset Store.

71
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:07,732
Or use the keyboard shortcut

72
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:09,732
command + 9  on mac,

73
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,388
or control + 9 on windows.

74
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,373
The Asset Store is a service that

75
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:17,373
Unity Technologies provides

76
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:19,373
where creators can both buy and sell

77
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,373
assets to make games.

78
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:25,643
These include art, music, scripts, effects,

79
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:28,748
all the way up to complete games and projects.

80
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:32,316
Unity also publishes content

81
00:03:32,316 --> 00:03:34,316
to the Asset Store, including teaching

82
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,316
projects like this one to help

83
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,316
you learn how to make games.

84
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,328
By default the Asset Store is

85
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,328
opened as a docked tab.

86
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:46,077
Let's undock the tab so that we can

87
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,077
expand the window.

88
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:00,326
In the upper-right corner of

89
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,326
the expanded Asset Store window

90
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,264
we'll see a listing of asset categories.

91
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,916
At the bottom we should find 

92
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,916
Unity Essentials.

93
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,916
Expand this category and we'll find

94
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,387
a subcategory called Sample Projects.

95
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,538
Within Sample Projects we'll find

96
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,558
an item called 2D UFO tutorial.

97
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:25,007
Click on the item title to open it.

98
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,158
Once the page loads we'll see a

99
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:31,364
download button in the upper-left corner.

100
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:33,364
Click on the Download button to begin

101
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:35,364
downloading the assets.

102
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,752
The Download button will be replaced

103
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,752
by the percentage of the download completed

104
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:41,752
once we click on it.

105
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:44,307
Once the download is complete we'll see

106
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,574
a dialogue labelled Importing Complete Project.

107
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,434
This warns us that importing a

108
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,855
complete project will overwrite

109
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,855
our current project settings.

110
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,382
In this case, because we've just created a

111
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,382
new project this is fine.

112
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,960
Click the Import button to continue.

113
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
Next we'll be given a choice

114
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
of which assets we would like to

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
import in to our project.

116
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,827
The default is All, which is what we want,

117
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:14,827
so go ahead and click Import.

118
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:18,325
Close the Asset Store window.

119
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,059
We now have our new project with our assets imported.

120
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:24,339
And the default new empty scene open.

121
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,432
Before creating anything in the new scene

122
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,432
we need to save our scene.

123
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:31,432
We can save our scene by choosing

124
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,432
File - Save Scene,

125
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:36,715
or by using the keyboard shortcut 

126
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,492
command + S on mac,

127
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,492
or control + S on windows.

128
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,850
I'm going to save this scene

129
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,850
in the Assets directory in the

130
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,850
folder called Scenes.

131
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,329
I'm going to call the scene Main.

132
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,003
We can now see in our Scenes folder

133
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:04,003
the scene called Main.

134
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,445
It's worth noting that the

135
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:11,271
Completed, Prefabs, Scenes, Scripts

136
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,271
and Sprites folders

137
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:17,395
were all created when we imported our asset package.

138
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,586
The Completed folder contains

139
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:24,857
a completed version of the project,

140
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:27,447
which you can refer to if you get stuck.

141
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:31,575
Great, that's the end of our first lesson.

142
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:35,648
In our next lesson we're going to lay out our play field.

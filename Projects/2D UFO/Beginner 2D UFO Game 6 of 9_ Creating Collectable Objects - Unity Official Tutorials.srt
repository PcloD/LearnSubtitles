1
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:05,599
So far we have created a play field

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,807
and a Player game object

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,807
and we have the player moving

4
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:11,807
under our control.

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:13,807
In this lesson we'll create

6
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,112
the collectable objects

7
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:18,112
for our player to pick up.

8
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:21,097
First open the Sprites folder.

9
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:24,026
Drag the sprite Pickup

10
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,026
in to the hierarchy.

11
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:32,353
You'll notice after dragging in

12
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:34,353
the Pickup sprite that we

13
00:00:34,353 --> 00:00:35,795
still can't see it.

14
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,811
That's because it's being rendered

15
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:42,359
behind both the Player

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,359
and Background sprites.

17
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,359
To bring it forward we

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,267
need to set the sorting layer

19
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,267
in the sprite renderer component.

20
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:56,442
Set the sorting layer to Pickups.

21
00:00:58,952 --> 00:01:00,952
Now the Player game object

22
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:02,952
is still in the way.

23
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:06,121
This is because the Player

24
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,121
sorting layer is in front

25
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:10,121
of the Pickups sorting layer.

26
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:13,995
Let's temporarily deactivate

27
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:15,995
the Player game object.

28
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,342
Select the Player game object

29
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,342
and deselect the checkbox

30
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:22,342
in front of the Name field.

31
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,866
This is the game object's Active checkbox.

32
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,422
Deselecting it will deactivate

33
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,615
the game object in the scene.

34
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:32,615
This will give us a clear working space

35
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:34,615
for our new pickup object

36
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,172
which we can now see.

37
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,031
Focus the scene view camera on the

38
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,031
pickup object by highlighting it

39
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:43,031
and pressing the F key whilst

40
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,031
the cursor is over the scene view.

41
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:48,043
So that we can collide with the pickup

42
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:50,858
let's add a circle collider 2D 

43
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,509
component to it.

44
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,509
With the pickup highlighted click

45
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,109
Add Component - Physics 2D 

46
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,597
then Circle Collider 2D.

47
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,968
Adjust the Radius property

48
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:05,968
of the circle collider 2D

49
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,292
so that it fits the sprite artwork visually b

50
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:11,887
by dragging in the Radius field.

51
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:15,454
To be effective the collectable

52
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:18,071
must attract the attention of the player.

53
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:21,141
So let's make the object more attractive.

54
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:24,012
There's one thing I feel certainly

55
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,012
attracts the attention of a player

56
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,803
and that is movement.

57
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:29,540
So let's rotate our pickup.

58
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:32,384
One way to do this is with a script.

59
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:35,924
With the pickup object still selected

60
00:02:35,924 --> 00:02:37,924
use the Add Component button

61
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,924
in the inspector.

62
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:43,294
Let's create a new script called Rotator.

63
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,365
Click Create and Add to confirm

64
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:48,365
and let's organise the script by

65
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:50,365
placing it in the Scripts folder.

66
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,445
Open the Scripts folder and

67
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,445
double click to open it for editing.

68
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,775
We want the sprite to spin and we want

69
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:02,775
to do it with this script.

70
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:04,775
Let's remove the sample code

71
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,775
 we don't need.

72
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:09,718
We will not be using forces

73
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,718
so we can use Update

74
00:03:11,718 --> 00:03:13,718
rather than Fixed Update.

75
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:17,362
We want to rotate the object every frame.

76
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:19,362
To make the pickups spin we

77
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:22,025
don't want to set the transform rotation

78
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:24,679
but we want to rotate the transform.

79
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,757
Type Transform inside Update.

80
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,767
Select it and hold down the 

81
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:36,168
control key on windows or the command 

82
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,684
key on mac and type '

83
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,512
Again this brings up the page

84
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,329
with a search term Transform.

85
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,845
Select Transform.

86
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:53,046
Scroll down until you see Transform's public functions.

87
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:57,930
There are two main ways to affect the transform. 

88
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,390
These are Translate and Rotate.

89
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:03,194
Translate moves the game object

90
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:05,194
using it's transform.

91
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,582
Rotate rotates the game object

92
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,582
using it's transform.

93
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:13,511
We will use rotate.

94
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,357
So let's click on the link.

95
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,694
This brings up the page for Transform.Rotate.

96
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:23,482
Note again the two signatures.

97
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:27,381
One is using a vector3

98
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,381
and the other is using 3

99
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,697
float values for X, Y or Z.

100
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,501
Both have the optional parameter

101
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:38,501
Space which we will

102
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,501
leave at default for this lesson.

103
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,153
Again we will choose the most simple

104
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:46,603
form that only uses the vector3 for direction.

105
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:49,497
Let's return to our code.

106
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,633
After transform,

107
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,633
making sure that transform is written to

108
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,245
begin with a lowercase t,

109
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:06,416
write .rotate (new Vector3 (0, 0, 45))

110
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:09,747
This means we'll rotate

111
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:12,179
around the Z axis.

112
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:14,857
Now this action also needs

113
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,596
to be smooth and frame rate independent

114
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,049
so we need to multiply the vector3 value

115
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,932
by Time.deltaTime.

116
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,430
It is worth noting that even

117
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,430
though we are working with a 2D

118
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,066
sprite we are using a vector3

119
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,846
to rotate the collectable's transform.

120
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:37,373
This is because the transform

121
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,373
of the 2D sprite

122
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,274
still exists in the 3D volume.

123
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,037
When using the transform component

124
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:47,037
with 2D objects we simply

125
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:49,908
ignore the axis we don't need.

126
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:53,317
Now that we are done with our Rotator script

127
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:55,944
save this script and return to Unity.

128
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,371
Let's test by entering play mode.

129
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:03,368
And we can see our pickup object rotates.

130
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,909
Let's exit play mode.

131
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:10,551
Okay, we have the start of a working

132
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,256
pickup object.

133
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,256
Next we want to place these pickups

134
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:16,062
around the game area.

135
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:18,672
But before we do this we need to do

136
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:20,142
one important step.

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
We need to make our pickup object

138
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,271
in to a prefab.

139
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,102
Remember, a prefab is an

140
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,102
asset that contains a template

141
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:31,768
or blueprint of a game object

142
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,768
or game object family.

143
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,378
We create a prefab from an

144
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:39,650
existing game object or game object family

145
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,122
and once we create it

146
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:44,122
we can use it in any scene

147
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,122
in our current project.

148
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,107
With a prefab of our pickup object

149
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,107
we will be able to make changes to

150
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,107
a single instance in our scene

151
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:55,387
or to the prefab asset itself.

152
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:57,886
And all of the pickup objects in our

153
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,883
game will be updated with those changes.

154
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:03,758
You'll notice we already have a folder

155
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,437
to hold our prefabs.

156
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
Let's drag the Pickup game object

157
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
from our hierarchy and place

158
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,415
it in to our Prefabs folder.

159
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:15,395
When we drag and item from our hierarchy

160
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,395
in to our project view

161
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,395
we create a new prefab

162
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,395
asset in our project.

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Before we spread our collectables

164
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
around the game area we should create

165
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
a new game object

166
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
to hold our pickups and

167
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
to help organise our hierarchy.

168
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,101
Let's create a new game object.

169
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:39,126
And call it Pickups.

170
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,443
Check the transform to make sure our

171
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,443
Pickups holder object

172
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:48,122
is at origin, or (0, 0, 0).

173
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,553
And if not use the component

174
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,553
context menu to reset it.

175
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:57,259
Next drag our Pickup game object on to it.

176
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,077
Now we want to spread a

177
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:02,077
number of these pickup objects

178
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:03,524
around the play area.

179
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,524
Make sure the pickup game object is

180
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:07,524
selected, and not the parent.

181
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:11,008
Now let's back out a little

182
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,008
so we can see the entire game area.

183
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,033
Click and drag the pickup game object

184
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,033
to move it in to the 

185
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,033
first pickup position.

186
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,957
I'm going to place mine at the top of the playing area.

187
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,678
With the game object still selected

188
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:28,555
duplicate it.

189
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,555
This can be done either by selecting

190
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:34,786
Edit - Duplicate, or by using the hot key combination.

191
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,369
This is command-D on mac,

192
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,369
or control-D on windows.

193
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,895
Now let's position the

194
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,895
second instance of the prefab.

195
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:49,558
Using the hot keys we will

196
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,558
create a few more, placing them

197
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,558
around the play area.

198
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Okay, I've created 12.

199
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,135
Let's hit play and test.

200
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:16,522
Excellent, these pickup prefabs

201
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,118
are working great.

202
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:20,118
In the next assignment we'll learn how to

203
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,524
pick them up and to count them.

1
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,487
Now we need a tool to

2
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:09,754
store the value of our counted collectables.

3
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:12,392
And another tool to add

4
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,392
to that value as we

5
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:16,060
collect and count them.

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,739
Let's add this tool to our

7
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,739
PlayerController script.

8
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,696
Select the Player game object

9
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:27,845
and open the PlayerController script for editing.

10
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,602
Let's add a private variable

11
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:37,074
to hold our count

12
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,074
of collectables we've picked up.

13
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,767
This will be an int,

14
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:43,767
as our count will be a whole number

15
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:46,113
we won't be collecting partial objects.

16
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:48,862
And let's call it Count.

17
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:54,198
Type private int count;

18
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,324
So in our game we will

19
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,726
first start with a count of 0.

20
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,461
Then we will need to increment

21
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,797
our count value by 1

22
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:06,797
when we pick up a new object.

23
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:11,325
We need to set our count value to 0.

24
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:14,237
As this variable is private

25
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:16,237
we don't have any access to it

26
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:18,237
in the inspector.

27
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:20,237
This variable is only available

28
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:23,132
for use within this script.

29
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:25,575
And as such we will need to set

30
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:28,216
it's starting value here in the script.

31
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,882
There are several ways we can set the starting value

32
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,882
of count but in this assignment

33
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:35,441
we will do it in the Start function.

34
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,245
In Start set our count

35
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,245
to be equal to 0.

36
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:44,579
Type count = 0

37
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:47,865
Next we need to add to count

38
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:50,690
when we pick up our collectable game objects.

39
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,550
We will pick up our objects

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,299
in onTriggerEnter2D

41
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,299
if the other game object

42
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,299
has the tag Pickup.

43
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:03,384
So this is where we add our counting code.

44
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:06,077
After setting the other game object's

45
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,077
active state to false

46
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,077
we'll set our new value

47
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,077
for count to be equal to our

48
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:14,601
old value plus 1.

49
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:21,999
We'll type count = count + 1.

50
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,955
There are other ways to add,

51
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,955
count up or increment a value

52
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:29,955
when coding in Unity,

53
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,581
but this one is very easy to understand

54
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,860
and this is the one that we're going to use in this assignment.

55
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:38,287
Let's save our script and return to Unity.

56
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,269
Now we can store and

57
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,269
increment our count but we have no

58
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,269
way of displaying it.

59
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,269
It would also be good to display a message

60
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,269
when the game is over.

61
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,309
To display text we will be using

62
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,309
Unity's user interface,

63
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,544
or UI toolset.

64
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,238
First let's create a new

65
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,238
UI text element

66
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:07,035
from the hierarchy's Create menu.

67
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,068
We seem to have gotten more than we've bargained for.

68
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,456
We don't just have a UI text element

69
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,456
but we've also created a

70
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,804
parent canvas element

71
00:03:21,804 --> 00:03:25,105
and an EventSystem game object.

72
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,076
These are all required

73
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:30,076
by the UI toolset.

74
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:32,783
The single most important thing

75
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,022
about these additional items is that

76
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,022
all UI elements must

77
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:39,022
be the child of a canvas

78
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:41,022
to behave correctly.

79
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:44,324
For more information on the UI tools

80
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,764
including the canvas and the EventSystem

81
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:50,157
please see the information linked below.

82
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,996
Let's rename the text element

83
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,996
CountText.

84
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,254
With the CountText still highlighted

85
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,547
place the cursor over the scene view

86
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:07,950
and press the F key to frame select it.

87
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,420
Let's zoom out so that we can see

88
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,975
where the text is positioned

89
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,975
relative to the entire canvas.

90
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,639
If for some reason this doesn't appear in

91
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,639
the centre then we can use the

92
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,639
context sensitive gear menu

93
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,209
to reset the rect transform.

94
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,373
Now that our text is centred let's

95
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:31,846
customise this element a bit.

96
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,846
The default text is a bit dark,

97
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,846
let's make the text colour yellow

98
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:37,846
so it's easier to see.

99
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:40,276
Click on the colour swatch

100
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,870
in the colour picker let's set

101
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,385
the red value to 255, 

102
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,385
the green value to 255 and

103
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,385
the blue value to 0.

104
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,092
You can do this by clicking and dragging

105
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,520
or entering the values numerically.

106
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:58,951
Close the colour picker.

107
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,951
Now let's add some placeholder text

108
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,951
and replace the string New Text

109
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:04,951
with Count Text.

110
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:08,061
Currently the text element

111
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,061
is in the centre of the screen

112
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,061
because it's anchored to the

113
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,061
centre of it's parent, which is

114
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,061
in this case the canvas.

115
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,061
If is worth noting that the 

116
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,531
transform component on UI elements

117
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,531
is different from that of 

118
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,531
other game objects in Unity.

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
For UI elements the standard

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
transform has been replaced

121
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
with the rect transform,

122
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,710
which takes in to account

123
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,710
many specialised features

124
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,103
necessary for a versatile UI system

125
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:42,199
including anchoring and positioning.

126
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:45,765
For more information on the rect transform

127
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,765
please see the information linked below.

128
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:51,138
One of the easiest ways to move

129
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:53,138
the CountText element in to the

130
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:55,138
upper left is to anchor it

131
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:58,069
to the upper left corner of the canvas

132
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,069
rather than to it's centre.

133
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,262
When we re-anchor this text

134
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,262
element we also want

135
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,262
to set the pivot and the

136
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:10,255
position based on the new anchor.

137
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:12,907
To do this open the

138
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,172
Anchors And Presets menu

139
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,172
by clicking on the button displaying

140
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,172
the current anchor preset.

141
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:24,256
Hold down the Shift and Option keys on Mac,

142
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:28,274
or shift and Alt keys on Windows

143
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:33,066
and select the upper left preset by clicking on it.

144
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:36,579
That's done it. 

145
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,274
Now it looks budged up against

146
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,274
the corner of the game view.

147
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,274
Let's give it some space between the

148
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,567
text and the edges of the screen.

149
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,902
As we're anchored to the upper left

150
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:49,902
corner of the canvas and we've

151
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:53,084
set our pivot to the upper left corner as well.

152
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,763
The easiest way to give the text

153
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:57,763
a little breathing room is to

154
00:06:57,763 --> 00:07:00,303
change the rect transform's

155
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,303
position X and 

156
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,303
position Y values.

157
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:08,546
In this case an X position of 10

158
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:11,288
and a Y position of -10

159
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:13,288
seem about right.

160
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,814
This gives us some room around it

161
00:07:16,814 --> 00:07:19,552
yet it's still up and out of the way.

162
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,979
Now let's wire up

163
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,979
the UI text element to

164
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,818
display our count value.

165
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:32,122
Let's start by opening the

166
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,499
PlayerController script for editing.

167
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,086
Before we can code anything related to

168
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,086
any UI elements we need to tell

169
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,086
our script more about them.

170
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:48,086
The details about the UI

171
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,086
toolset are held in what's

172
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,086
called a namespace.

173
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,835
We need to use this namespace

174
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,835
just as we are using

175
00:07:56,835 --> 00:08:00,121
UnityEngine and System.Collections.

176
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,358
So to do this, at the top of our script

177
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:09,211
we'll write using UnityEngine.UI

178
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,835
With this in place we can now

179
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,394
write our code.

180
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,112
First create a new public

181
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,632
text variable called CountText

182
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:22,062
to hold a reference to the

183
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,062
UI Text component 

184
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,425
on our UI Text game object.

185
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:31,996
Type public Text countText

186
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:35,689
We need to set the starting value

187
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:39,132
of the UI text's Text property.

188
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:42,336
WE can do this in Start as well.

189
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:54,482
Write countText.text = "Count: " + count.ToString ()

190
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,969
And we need the parenthesis.

191
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,969
Now this line of code

192
00:08:59,969 --> 00:09:01,969
must be written after the line

193
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:03,969
setting our count value

194
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,875
because Count must have some value 

195
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,875
for us to set the text with.

196
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:11,602
Now we also need to update this text

197
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,602
property every time we pick up

198
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,061
a new collectable,

199
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,061
so in OnTriggerEnter

200
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,267
after we increment our count value

201
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,802
let's write again

202
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:28,250
countText.Text = "Count: " + count.ToString ()

203
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:32,398
We've now written the same line of code

204
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,398
twice in the same script.

205
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,030
This is generally bad form.

206
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,805
One way to made this a little more elegant

207
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,805
is to create a function that

208
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:43,805
does the work in one place

209
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:45,805
and we simply call this function

210
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:47,470
every time we need it.

211
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:50,074
Let's create a new function called

212
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:52,074
SetCountText.

213
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:56,551
Type void SetCountText

214
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,946
followed by an empty set of parenthesis

215
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,689
and an empty set of brackets.

216
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,701
Now let's move one

217
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,701
instance of this line of code

218
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:09,757
in to the function by cutting and pasting it.

219
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:19,155
And in it's place let's put

220
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:22,287
a line of code simply calling the function.

221
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,789
Finally let's replace the

222
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,608
other line with the function call as well.

223
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:32,492
Save and return to Unity.

224
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:38,526
Now we see our PlayerController script

225
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,526
has a new text property.

226
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,526
We can associate a reference to our

227
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:46,558
Count Text simply by dragging and dropping

228
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:49,177
the CountText game object

229
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:51,177
on to this slot.

230
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:53,177
Unity will find the text component

231
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,177
on the game object and correctly

232
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,177
associate the reference.

233
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,904
Let's save the scene and play.

234
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:09,291
Great, now not only do we collect

235
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,643
these objects but we can count them now.

236
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:15,461
Let's exit play mode.

237
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,461
We need to display a message

238
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,701
when we have collected all of the pickups.

239
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:22,283
To do this we will need another

240
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,283
UI text object.

241
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,125
Again, using the hierarchy's Create menu

242
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,294
make a new UI text game object.

243
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,498
Rename it WinText.

244
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,849
Note how the new UI text element is

245
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:43,743
automatically added to our canvas.

246
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,743
We want this text to display

247
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,520
in the centre of the game space

248
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
but up a little bit so it doesn't

249
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
cover the Player game object.

250
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,385
To do this let's adjust the rect transform's

251
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:59,065
position Y element as by default

252
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,065
this UI text element is anchored

253
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:03,065
to the centre of the canvas.

254
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:12,029
A value of about 75 feels good.

255
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,948
Let's also adjust the

256
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,948
paragraph alignment

257
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,438
in the text component.

258
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,956
Next let's adjust the colour

259
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:26,651
and set it to the same yellow

260
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,321
we used for our previous text element.

261
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:33,159
Let's make the text a little larger

262
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,029
by setting the font size to 24.

263
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,915
Finally let's add some place holder text

264
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:42,472
and replace the string New Text

265
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,472
with Win Text.

266
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,910
Let's save the scene and swap

267
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,910
back to our scripting editor.

268
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:54,818
We need to add a reference for

269
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:56,818
this UI text element.

270
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,818
Let's create a new public text

271
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:01,621
variable and call it WinText.

272
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:07,286
Type public Text winText.

273
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,831
Now let's set the starting value

274
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:14,420
for WinText's text property.

275
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,751
This is set to an empty string

276
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,751
or two double quote marks

277
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,879
with no content.

278
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,644
This text property will start empty

279
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:27,896
then in the SetCountText function

280
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:34,553
let's write if count is greater than or equal to 12,

281
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,090
which is the total number of objects we have

282
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,090
in the game to collect,

283
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,621
then our winText.Text

284
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,621
equals You Win!

285
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:53,189
Type if count is greater than or equal to 12

286
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:02,284
winText.Text = YouWin!

287
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,337
Let's save this script and return to Unity.

288
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:14,379
Again on our Player our player

289
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,320
controller has a new UI text property.

290
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:19,936
We can associate the component again

291
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:21,936
by dragging the WinText

292
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,428
game object in to the new slot.

293
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,550
Let's save the scene and play.

294
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,774
So we're picking up our game objects,

295
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,774
we're counting our collectables

296
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:40,250
and we win!

297
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,250
And as we can see when we have

298
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,024
collected 12 objects we display the You Win! text.

299
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,830
In the next and last assignment

300
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,830
of this series we will build

301
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,830
the game and deploy it

302
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,052
using a stand alone player.

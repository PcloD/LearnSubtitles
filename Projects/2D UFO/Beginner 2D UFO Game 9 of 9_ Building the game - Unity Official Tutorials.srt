1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,690
Now that we've finished our game

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,432
we need to present it to our players.

3
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,125
One of the greatest things about Unity

4
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,125
is that once we have created

5
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:14,125
our game we can deploy it

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,229
to many of the current platforms available.

7
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,144
For more detailed information on

8
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,144
building and build targets

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,560
please see the information linked below.

10
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:27,572
Before we build our game

11
00:00:27,572 --> 00:00:29,572
we should save our scene.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,210
To build our game we must

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,646
first open the Build Settings window.

14
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:39,823
We can do this by selecting File - Build Settings

15
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,637
or by using the key combination of 

16
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:47,336
Shift + Command or Control + B.

17
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,349
This brings up the Build Settings window.

18
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,959
Our current build target is

19
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,959
indicated by the Unity logo.

20
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:00,611
The blue highlight indicates our

21
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:02,611
focus and shows us on the

22
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,611
right hand side the build

23
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,699
options for the currently selected platform.

24
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:12,026
We want to build a standalone application.

25
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,457
This is our current build target,

26
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:18,218
PC, Mac and Linux Standalone.

27
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,986
We do not need to change our build target.

28
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:23,986
If we did want to change our built target

29
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:27,859
we can select the desired platform from the list

30
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,789
and click the Switch Platforms button

31
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,789
at the bottom of the window.

32
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:37,370
Let's now return our build target

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,370
to the standalone player.

34
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,823
Once we have selected our new build target

35
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,823
we need to add the scenes we want

36
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:49,999
to build to the Build Settings window.

37
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,999
We can add the current scene by

38
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,442
clicking the Add Current button.

39
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,984
Or we can drag and drop

40
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,597
any scene from our project view

41
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,597
in to the field at the top of the

42
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:03,597
Build Settings window.

43
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,471
It's worth noting that we don't need

44
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,903
to include every scene in our project.

45
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,511
We only need to include the scenes we

46
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:13,511
want in our game.

47
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:15,511
It's also possible to perform a build

48
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,322
with no scenes in the Build Settings window.

49
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,905
If we do this Unity will simply

50
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:22,905
build our game using the

51
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,905
current scene we have open for editing.

52
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:29,655
Now we are ready to build our game.

53
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,792
Let's click the Build button.

54
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,802
This will bring up a dialogue box

55
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:40,430
asking us to choose a build location.

56
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,925
We can build the game nearly anywhere 

57
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:46,189
we want to on our accessible drives or network.

58
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,841
I like to associate my build location

59
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,841
with my project so I will

60
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:52,841
create a new folder inside my project

61
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,841
called Builds.

62
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:57,354
This folder must be placed only 

63
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:59,354
on the root of our project,

64
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:02,437
along side the Assets and Library folders.

65
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:05,255
If the build is saved in the Assets

66
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:07,546
or Library folder

67
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:09,546
Unity will attempt to treat

68
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:12,261
the built files as asset

69
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,632
or library files, which could damage the project.

70
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:19,854
When building for the Mac Unity builds a

71
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:23,217
.app bundle, which contains all of the

72
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:25,702
relevant data and files in one package.

73
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:27,924
When building for Windows,

74
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:31,412
Unity builds a .exe file

75
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:35,640
and a data folder, which contains all of the necessary resources.

76
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,611
To keep things organised I like to make

77
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,611
a separate folder for each build

78
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,611
within the Builds folder.

79
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:46,456
I'll make a folder called UFO Game Build 1

80
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,563
And save the build inside it.

81
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,586
Unity will now build the application

82
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,586
and save it to our Builds folder.

83
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,571
To run the game, simply run the

84
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,977
executable application, and now we are running our game.

85
00:04:19,917 --> 00:04:21,917
And we win!

86
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,609
So in these assignments we have learned how to

87
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,609
create new game objects,

88
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,609
how to position them in the scene,

89
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:31,609
add new components to them,

90
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,609
and write our own custom behaviours

91
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,609
for them using simple scripting.

92
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,024
We've seen how to use cameras,

93
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,024
2D colliders, 2D triggers

94
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,024
and 2D rigid bodies.

95
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:44,397
We can collect and count objects.

96
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:47,021
Though this is a very simple example

97
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,021
it covers a large set of basic

98
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,021
subjects important to understanding

99
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,021
how to use Unity.

100
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,506

00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,181
Thanks for watching.

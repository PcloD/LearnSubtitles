1
00:00:01,581 --> 00:00:03,192
In this beginner assignment we are going

2
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05,192
to make a very simple but playable game to

3
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:07,192
use many of the basic concepts from the

4
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:09,192
beginner tutorial modules.

5
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,192
We will be making a roll-a-ball game where

6
00:00:11,192 --> 00:00:13,494
we will collect special game objects.

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,939
We will see how to create new game objects,

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:18,213
add components to these game objects,

9
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:20,447
set the values on their properties and position

10
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:23,597
these game objects in the scene to create a game.

11
00:00:23,597 --> 00:00:25,597
In our game the player will control a ball

12
00:00:25,597 --> 00:00:27,765
rolling around the game board.

13
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,603
We will move the ball using physics and forces.

14
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,301
We will look at the input from the player

15
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:34,301
through the keyboard and we'll use those

16
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,301
inputs to apply forces to the ball, making it

17
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:37,995
move in our scene.

18
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,995
We will see how to detect contact between

19
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:42,527
the player's ball and the pick-up game objects,

20
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,088
and use these events to collect these

21
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,088
pick-up game objects.

22
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:48,417
When we are done we will have made a simple

23
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,417
roll-a-ball game where the player controls

24
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,947
the ball with the keyboard, picks up and 

25
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,947
counts special collectable objects,

26
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:55,947
displays the current count and ends the game

27
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:57,050
when all of the game objects

28
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,622
have been picked up.

29
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:01,404
We won't need to import any assets for this project.

30
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,157
We won't be using models, textures,

31
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:05,709
sounds or animations for this assignment.

32
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:07,971
We will simply use the primitive shapes

33
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:10,512
like cubes, spheres and planes

34
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,058
provided by Unity.

35
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,377
To begin, start with assignment 1 where we

36
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:16,862
setup our game and starting game objects.

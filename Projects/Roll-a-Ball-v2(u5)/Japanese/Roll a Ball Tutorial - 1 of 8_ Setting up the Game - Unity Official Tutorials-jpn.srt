1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,585
Let's begin by creating a new project.

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:08,631
We can create a new project from File - New Project.

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,134
This will bring up the home screen.

4
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:15,745
I'm going to call the new project Roll a Ball.

5
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:19,871
The next thing we need to do is set the destination,

6
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:21,874
or path to our new project.

7
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to put this new project on my desktop.

8
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,366
At this point it's worth noting that we can

9
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,648
have our new project use default settings

10
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:35,682
for either a 2D project or a 3D project.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,040
We will choose 3D.

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,031
And then I will click on Create Project

13
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,378
to make a new project.

14
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:46,090
We now have our new project with a new empty scene.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,090
Before creating anything in the new scene

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,451
we need to save our scene.

17
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:54,470
We can save our scene by going to File - Save Scene

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,470
or by using the keyboard shortcut.

19
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:01,260
I'm going to save this scene in the Assets directory

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,357
in a new folder called _scenes.

21
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:07,139
The underscore is optional, I use it to sort this

22
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:09,793
folder to the top of my project window.

23
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:12,514
Now I'm going to call the scene MiniGame.

24
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,054
We can now see in our Scenes folder

25
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:19,054
the scene called MiniGame.

26
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:23,704
Let's create our game board, or play field.

27
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:26,538
To do this we will use a stock Unity plane.

28
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,896
We can create this plane from either

29
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:31,682
Game Object - 3D Object - Plane.

30
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:37,422
Or from inside the Hierarchy view using the Create menu.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,532
Rename this game object Ground.

32
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,532
We can do this by either selecting the game object

33
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:45,712
and using the enter or return keys

34
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,220
to allow editing, or by clicking on the

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,413
game object twice, slowly.

36
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:52,787
Type in the new name or hit enter or return

37
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,787
to confirm this change.

38
00:01:55,287 --> 00:01:57,989
Reset the transform component using the context

39
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,387
sensitive gear menu in the upper right.

40
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,845
This will place the game object at the location of

41
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:05,353
(0, 0, 0) in our scene.

42
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:07,353
This point is known as the origin point

43
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,725
of the world and this is where all of the

44
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,416
coordinates in the scene are calculated from.

45
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,416
Now with the game object selected and the

46
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,674
cursor over the Scene view type the F key, or choose

47
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:20,187
Frame Selected from the Edit menu

48
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,885
to see the entire game object in the Scene view.

49
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:25,400
Looking at our current scene,

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,958
we can see grid lines indicating the plane at origin.

51
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,425
For the purposes of this project

52
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:32,988
we will turn them off.

53
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,984
Select the Gizmos menu in the Scene view

54
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,984
and deselect Show Grid.

55
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,327
We need to change the scale of the ground plane.

56
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:46,649
We can do this in a number of ways..

57
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,447
We can use the Scale tool,

58
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:51,086
simply grab the axis handle you want to change

59
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,791
and drag the handle rescaling the plane.

60
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,791
We can click and drag on the title of

61
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,791
the fields we want to change.

62
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:00,779
Or we can type a number directly in to the

63
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,185
field we want to change.

64
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,949
You can tab between fields and hit enter or return

65
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,949
to confirm your choice.

66
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:10,431
Now remember a plane has no volume

67
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:12,886
and scale does not work on the Y axis.

68
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:15,796
There will be no change unless you go in to negative numbers.

69
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,060
In this case the plane, which is a single

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,044
sided object will simply face the other direction.

71
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,830
If you place a plane in the scene and you can't see it

72
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,821
check your orientation between the plane and camera

73
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:28,821
and make sure that you have the correct values

74
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,488
for the Y axis of scale.

75
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:33,082
This is usually the value of 1.

76
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,968
Let's create our player object.

77
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,968
In this assignment our player object

78
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,968
will be a Unity sphere.

79
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:44,953
From the Hierarchy - Create menu select Sphere.

80
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:48,033
Rename the sphere Player.

81
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:52,810
Reset the transform to make sure it's a origin.

82
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:56,293
Select Edit - Frame Selected

83
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:59,046
or use the F key while the cursor is

84
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:01,297
over the Scene view to focus our Scene view

85
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:03,297
camera on our game object.

86
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,413
See how the sphere is buried in the plane?

87
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,413
This is because both game objects

88
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,997
are in the exact same location in the scene,

89
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,523
the origin point, or (0, 0, 0)

90
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,523
on the X, Y and Z axis.

91
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,523
We need to move the player's sphere up

92
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,523
until it rests on the plane.

93
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:27,874
All Unity primitive objects, cubes, spheres, capsules,

94
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:30,150
have a standard size, they are either

95
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,059
1 by 1 by 1 or 1 by 2 by 1 Unity units.

96
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,059
As such we simply lift the player object up

97
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,059
by half a unit in the Y axis

98
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:42,234
and we know it is laying perfectly on top of plane.

99
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,696
If we look in the Game view we can that the

100
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,696
player game object is lit and it

101
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:50,696
casts a shadow on the plane.

102
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,514
All new Unity scenes come with the

103
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:55,514
default sky box and a directional light

104
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:58,641
to represent the sun, so we don't need to worry

105
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,641
about setting up any default lighting.

106
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:03,732
What could be improved however is the

107
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:06,935
white player sphere on the white background.

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,410
Let's add some colour to our background

109
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,120
so there is some contrast between the player and the play field.

110
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,211
To add colour or texture to a model

111
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:19,598
we need to use a material.

112
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,358
We won't go in to the details of materials now,

113
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,064
and we won't be using any textures.

114
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,672
We will simply use a standard material

115
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,672
to add colour to the objects in our scene.

116
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,922
First let's create a new folder in our

117
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,695
project to hold our materials.

118
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,582
We can do this by using the project's

119
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:41,397
Create menu and selecting Folder.

120
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:46,055
Rename this folder Material.

121
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:48,808
With the Materials folder selected

122
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:51,245
use the project's Create menu again

123
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,792
and this time select Material.

124
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:58,319
Note how the material was created in the Materials folder.

125
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,867
This is because we had the folder selected

126
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:03,370
when we chose to create our new material

127
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,569
Rename this material Background.

128
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:10,054
Select the material and under Main Maps

129
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:13,011
the first property is Albido.

130
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:15,011
Click on the Albido's colour field

131
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,806
to open a colour picker.

132
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:20,276
Change the colour to a nice dark shade of blue.

133
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:26,053
In our case I will use the RGB values of 0, 32, 64.

134
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,939
For a preview of the material make sure 

135
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,939
that the preview window is open.

136
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:35,348
To apply the texture to the plane,

137
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,014
simply select the material in the project view

138
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,538
and drag it on to the plane in the scene view.

139
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:44,221
Now the player stands out on the dark blue background.

140
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:46,857
I want to make one additional change that

141
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,857
will help us later in this project.

142
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,794
I want to rotate the main directional light

143
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,273
so that we have better lighting on our player.

144
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,893
Select the directional light and in the transform component

145
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:03,334
change the Transform Rotation on the Y axis to 60.

146
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:07,501
This will give better shape to our player sphere.

147
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:11,757
Now we have a player game object and a background play field.

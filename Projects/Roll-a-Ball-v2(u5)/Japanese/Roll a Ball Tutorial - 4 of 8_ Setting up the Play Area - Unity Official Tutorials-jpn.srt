1
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:04,499
So let's set up our play field.

2
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:07,043
The play field for our game will be very simple.

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:09,361
We will place walls around the edges

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,885
to keep our player game object from falling off

5
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,440
and we will create and place a set of collectable

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,149
objects for our player to pick up.

7
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:19,606
First let's create a new game object

8
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:21,427
and rename it Walls.

9
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:24,099
This will be an organising parent game object

10
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,685
for our Wall objects.

11
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:28,603
Reset this game object to origin.

12
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,783
Now we will build our walls.

13
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:15,935
Let's start by creating a new cube

14
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,935
to be our first wall.

15
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:21,439
Rename this West Wall.

16
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,090
Reset this game object to origin.

17
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,826
Now parent West Wall to our Walls game object.

18
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,392
Let's focus our Scene view camera

19
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:34,961
to our Wall object.

20
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,556
We can do this by typing the F key

21
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,556
while the cursor is over the Scene view

22
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:43,353
or by selecting Edit - Frame Selected.

23
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,602
We need to change the size of the cube to fit

24
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,602
one side of our play area.

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,318
Change the cube's transform scale of X, Y and Z to

26
00:01:56,318 --> 00:02:01,338
.5 for thin, 2 for tall and 20.5 for long.

27
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:04,292
Now we can simply push the wall in to place

28
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,698
using the Translate tool

29
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:09,700
or we could enter a value in to the transform component.

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,700
In this case we can set the transform's

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,822
position X value to -10.

32
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,181
This places the wall neatly to the edge of our play area.

33
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:21,532
To create the next wall we could

34
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,201
start with another new cube,

35
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:25,201
but then we'd have to rescale this

36
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,020
new cube before we placed it.

37
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,065
Our current West Wall is already the perfect size.

38
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:35,151
So let's duplicate the West Wall game object.

39
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,841
Let's rename it East Wall.

40
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:41,682
To place the wall simply remove the negative sign

41
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:44,985
and it pops in to place on the east side of our game area.

42
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,692
Now let's duplicate the east wall

43
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:52,192
and call it North Wall.

44
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,037
Reset the X position so the north wall

45
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:58,037
is in the centre of the play area.

46
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,522
We now have two choices.

47
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:03,144
We can rotate the wall by 90 degrees,

48
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:05,392
or, as this is a cuboid,

49
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:12,173
we can rescale the wall to 20.5 in the X and 0.5 in the Z.

50
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,648
Now it's scaled correctly for it's orientation

51
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:16,407
as the north wall.

52
00:03:17,018 --> 00:03:19,018
We can drag the wall in to place,

53
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,018
or we can simply use the value of 10

54
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:24,123
in the transform's position Z field to place it.

55
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:28,577
Duplicate North Wall and call it South Wall,

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,515
and -10 in the Z axis pops it in to place.

57
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:35,469
Enter play mode and test.

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,014
Fantastic, the walls work fine.

59
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,292
Remember to test early and test often,

60
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,964
don't wait to test.

61
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,196
Let's exit play mode.

62
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,596
Let's highlight the Player game object

63
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,693
and set the editor to Local mode,

64
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,773
and try again.

65
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,991
Note how in Local mode we can see the transform rotate.

66
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,701
Let's exit play mode.

67
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,228
In the next episode we will be creating

68
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,228
our collectable pickup object.

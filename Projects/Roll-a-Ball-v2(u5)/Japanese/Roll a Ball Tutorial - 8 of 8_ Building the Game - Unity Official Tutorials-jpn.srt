1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,144
Now that we've finished our game we need to 

2
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:04,851
present it to our players.

3
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:07,088
One of the greatest things about Unity is that

4
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:09,380
once we have created our game we can deploy

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,380
it to many of the current platforms.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,880
For more detailed information on building and

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,684
build targets please see the lesson linked below.

8
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:19,294
Before we build our game we should

9
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:20,779
save our scene.

10
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:22,779
To build our game we must first open

11
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,779
the Build Settings window.

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,083
We can do this by selecting File - Build Settings

13
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,789
or by using the key combination of

14
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,949
shift plus command or control plus B.

15
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,763
This brings up the Build Settings window.

16
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:42,180
Our current build target is indicated by the Unity logo.

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,180
The blue highlight indicates our focus and

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,950
shows us on the right hand side the build

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,538
options for the currently selected platform.

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,134
We want to build a standalone application.

21
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,774
This is our current build target.

22
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,679
PC, Mac and Linux Standalone.

23
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:02,998
We do not need to change our build target.

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,861
If we did want to change our build target

25
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,488
we can select the desired platform from the list

26
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:12,038
and click the Switch Platforms button at the bottom of the window.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,157
Let's now return our build target to the standalone player.

28
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:22,427
Once we have selected our new build target

29
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,648
we need to add the scenes we want to build

30
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:26,648
to the Build Settings window.

31
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:28,965
We can add the current scene by clicking the

32
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,646
Add Current button.

33
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:32,646
Or we can drag and drop any scene from our

34
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:34,986
project view in to the field at the top of

35
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:36,475
the Build Settings window.

36
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:40,419
It's worth noting that we don't need to

37
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,655
include every scene in our project.

38
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,185
We only need to include the scenes we

39
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:46,006
we want in our game.

40
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,006
It is also possible to perform a build

41
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:50,477
with no scenes in the build Settings window.

42
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,889
If we do this, Unity will simply build our game

43
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,611
using the current scene we have open for editing.

44
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,577
Now we are ready to build our game.

45
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:02,383
Let's return to the Build Settings window

46
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,217
and click the Build button.

47
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:06,217
This will bring up a dialogue box asking us

48
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:08,217
to choose a build location.

49
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:10,217
I like to associate my build location with

50
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,151
my project, so I will create a new folder

51
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:15,859
inside my project called Builds.

52
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,827
This folder must be placed only on the

53
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:21,827
root of our project alongside the

54
00:02:21,827 --> 00:02:23,827
assets and library folders.

55
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:28,549
With the build folder selected let's name the build

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,190
and then click save.

57
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,467
Unity will now build the application

58
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,467
and save it to our Builds folder

59
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:42,442
When building for the Mac Unity builds a .app bundle,

60
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:45,380
which contains all of the relevant data and files.

61
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,644
When building for Windows

62
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:51,041
Unity builds a .exe file

63
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:55,033
and a data folder which contains all of the necessary resources.

64
00:02:57,374 --> 00:03:01,462
To run the game, simply run the executable application.

65
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,203
And now we are running our game.

66
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:14,990
And, we win!

67
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:22,099
So in these assignments we have learned how to

68
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,385
create new game objects, how to position them in the scene,

69
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:28,658
add new components to them, write our own custom behaviours

70
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,658
for them using simple scripting.

71
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,824
We've seen how to use lights, cameras,

72
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:35,179
colliders, triggers, rigid bodies.

73
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,427
We can collect and count objects.

74
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,327
Though this is a very simple example,

75
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,327
it covers a large set of basic

76
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:44,277
subjects important to understanding how to use Unity.

77
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,534

1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:04,026
Counting, displaying text and ending the game.

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:06,026
We need a tool to store the value

3
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:07,636
of our counted collectables.

4
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:09,636
And another tool to add to that value

5
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,636
as we collect and count them.

6
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:14,710
Let's add this tool to our PlayerController script.

7
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,713
Select the player game object and open the 

8
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,713
PlayerController script for editing.

9
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:25,945
Let's add a private variable to hold our count.

10
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:27,945
This will be an int, as our count will be

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:31,129
a whole number, we won't be collecting partial objects,

12
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:33,129
and let's call it Count.

13
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,251
So in our game we will first start

14
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,762
with a count of 0.

15
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,762
Then we will need to increment our count value

16
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:42,388
by 1 when we pick up a new object.

17
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,646
First we need to set our count value to 0.

18
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,868
As this variable is private we don't have

19
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:49,868
any access to it in the Inspector.

20
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:53,560
This variable is only available for use within this script

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,150
and as such we will need to set it's starting value

22
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,801
here in the script.

23
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,801
There are several ways we can set the starting value

24
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:01,801
of Count, but in this assignment we will

25
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:03,801
do it in the Start function.

26
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:09,062
In Start set our Count to be equal to 0.

27
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,087
Next we need to add to Count when we pick up

28
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:14,390
our collectable game objects.

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,428
We will pick up our objects in OnTriggerEnter

30
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:21,210
if the Other game object has the tag Pickup.

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,913
So this is where we add our counting code.

32
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,913
After setting the other game objects

33
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:30,158
active state to False we add our new value of Count

34
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:34,755
is equal to our old value of Count plus 1.

35
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,219
There are other ways to add, count up or increment

36
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,939
the value when coding for Unity,

37
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,939
but this one is very easy to understand and 

38
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,751
this is the one that we're going to use in this assignment.

39
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:47,251
Save this script and return to Unity.

40
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:50,509
Now we can store and increment our count

41
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,509
but we have no way of displaying it.

42
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,539
It would also be good to display a message

43
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,067
when the game is over.

44
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:58,774
To display text in this assignment we will

45
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:00,774
be using simply GUI text objects

46
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,774
to display our text and values.

47
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,937
First let's create a new game object

48
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:07,618
to hold the GUI text items.

49
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,565
Let's call the new game object DisplayText

50
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,044
and make sure the transform is set to Origin.

51
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:17,511
Next create a GUI text game object

52
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,511
from the hierarchy's Create menu.

53
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:24,856
Attach it as a child to the Display Text parent game object.

54
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,549
Rename it Count Text.

55
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:31,403
We want our text to display in the upper

56
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,138
left of the screen when the game is playing.

57
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,491
We can see that the GUI text is currently

58
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,439
displaying in the centre of the screen in the game view.

59
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,574
This is because the transform of the GUI text

60
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:50,057
game object is set to 0.5 and 90.5 in the X and Y.

61
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:52,057
This is the centre of the viewport of the 

62
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:56,050
game view camera, which goes from 0.0 in the lower left

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,575
up to 1.1 in the upper right.

64
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:03,335
Let's change the GUI text's transform to 0.1

65
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:07,252
putting it in the top left of our camera's view port.

66
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,930
Now it looks budged up against the corner of the game view.

67
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,490
Let's give it some space between the text and the edges of the screen.

68
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,990
We don't need to juggle the transform here,

69
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,990
we can make small adjustments by setting the 

70
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,713
pixel offset property.

71
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:24,887
Let's bring it away from the side by 10 pixels

72
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:26,887
and bring it down by 10 pixels

73
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,287
That feels better now with some room around it.

74
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,287
Yet it's still up and out of the way.

75
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,293
So let's wire up this GUI text object

76
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:38,293
to display our Count value.

77
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:42,396
Start by opening the PlayerController script for editing.

78
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,547
Next create a new public GUI text variable

79
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,547
called CountText to hold a reference

80
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,547
to the GUI text component on our

81
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,547
CountText game object.

82
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,047
We need to set the starting value of the GUI

83
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,880
text's text property.

84
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
We can do this in Start as well

85
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:08,286
Write countText.Text equals the string value of Count: 

86
00:04:08,286 --> 00:04:13,143
plus count.ToString, and we need the parenthesis.

87
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,821
Now this line of code must be written

88
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:18,443
after the line setting our count value.

89
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:22,880
Count must have some value for us to set a text with.

90
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:25,948
Now we also need to update this text property

91
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,458
every time we pick up a new collectable

92
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,483
So in OnTriggerEnter after we increment our count

93
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,306
value let's write again

94
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:40,472
countText.Text = 'Count: ' + count.ToString();

95
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:44,717
Hmm, we've now written the same line of code

96
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,042
twice in the same script.

97
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:49,042
This is generally bad form.

98
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:51,764
One way to make this a little more elegant

99
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:55,000
is to create a function that does the work in one place

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,081
and we simply call this function every time we need it.

101
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:02,406
Let's create a new function with void SetCountText

102
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:05,411
and then an empty set of parenthesis and brackets.

103
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:09,344
Now let's move one instance of this line of code

104
00:05:09,344 --> 00:05:12,073
in to the function by cutting and pasting it.

105
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,309
And in it's place let's put a line of code

106
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:17,100
simply calling the function.

107
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,809
Finally let's replace the other line with

108
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,809
a function call as well.

109
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,329
Excellent. Save and swap back to Unity.

110
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,829
Now we see our PlayerController script has

111
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,829
a new GUI text property. 

112
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,846
We can associate a reference to our Count text

113
00:05:34,846 --> 00:05:36,846
simply by dragging and dropping the

114
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:39,830
CountText game object on to the slot.

115
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,830
Unity will find the GUI text component

116
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,799
on the game object and correctly associate the reference.

117
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,259
Now let's save, enter play mode and test.

118
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,394
Ah-ha! Not only do we collect

119
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:57,394
these objects but we count them now.

120
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,922
Let's exit play mode.

121
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,809
We need to display a message when we have

122
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,587
collected all of the cubes.

123
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:07,792
To do this we will need another GUI text object.

124
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,480
Again, using the hierarchy Create menu

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
make a new GUI text game object.

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,560
Rename it Win Text

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,344
and place it in our Display Text parent game object.

128
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
We want this text to display in the centre

129
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
of the game screen but up a little

130
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,826
so it doesn't cover the player game object.

131
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,963
Simply adjust the transform position Y to

132
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:35,059
0.75 so we stay centred but up a little.

133
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,973
Next let's adjust the anchor and alignment

134
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:42,576
to middle centre and centre to centre the text.

135
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,957
Save the scene and swap back to our scripting editor.

136
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:51,448
We need to add a reference for this new GUI text component.

137
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:53,448
Create a new public GUI text

138
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,205
variable and call it winText.

139
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,389
Now let's set the starting value for the

140
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,389
GUI text's text property.

141
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,166
This is set to an empty string or 

142
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,764
two double quote marks with no content.

143
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,535
This text property will start empty.

144
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:12,554
Then in the SetCountText function let's write

145
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:17,348
if Count is greater than or equal to 12,

146
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,348
which is the total number of objects we have in the

147
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:26,631
game to collect, then our winText.Text equals You Win.

148
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:29,768
Save this script and return to Unity.

149
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,441
Again on our player, our PlayerController

150
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,441
has a new GUI text property.

151
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,441
Associate the component again by dragging the

152
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,865
Win Text game object on to the slot.

153
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,962
Save the scene and play.

154
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:51,531
So we're picking up our game objects,

155
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,901
we're counting our collectables,

156
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:58,172
and

157
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,364
we win!

158
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:03,191
And as we can see when we have collected 12 objects

159
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,915
we display the 'You Win' text.

160
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:09,321
In the next and last assignment of this series

161
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,650
we will build and deploy this game as a web player.

1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:02,177
この初心者課題では、

2
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:04,177
基本的な初心者チュートリアルから、

3
00:00:04,177 --> 00:00:06,177
基本概念を多く使用し、非常に単純ではありますが

4
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:08,177
プレイできるゲームを作ります。

5
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,177
We will be making a roll-a-ball game where

6
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,479
we will collect special game objects.

7
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:14,924
We will see how to create new game objects,

8
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:17,198
add components to these game objects,

9
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,432
set the values on their properties and position

10
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,582
these game objects in the scene to create a game.

11
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:24,582
In our game the player will control a ball

12
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,750
rolling around the game board.

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,588
We will move the ball using physics and forces.

14
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:31,286
We will look at the input from the player

15
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:33,286
through the keyboard and we'll use those

16
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:35,286
inputs to apply forces to the ball, making it

17
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,980
move in our scene.

18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,980
We will see how to detect contact between

19
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,512
the player's ball and the pick-up game objects.

20
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,073
and use these events to collect these

21
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:45,073
pick-up game objects.

22
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:47,402
When we are done we will have made a simple

23
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:49,402
roll-a-ball game where the player controls

24
00:00:49,402 --> 00:00:50,932
the ball with the keyboard, picks up and 

25
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:52,932
counts special collectable objects,

26
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:54,932
displays the current count and ends the game

27
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,035
when all of the game objects have

28
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,607
been picked up.

29
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:00,389
We won't need to import any assets for this project.

30
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,142
We won't be using models, textures,

31
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:04,694
sounds or animations for this assignment.

32
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,956
We will simply use the primitive shapes

33
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:09,497
like cubes, spheres and planes

34
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:11,043
provided by Unity.

35
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:13,362
To begin start with assignment 1 where we

36
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,847
setup our game and starting game objects.

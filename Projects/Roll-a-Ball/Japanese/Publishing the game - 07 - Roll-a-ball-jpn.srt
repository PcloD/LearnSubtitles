1
00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:03,090
Now that we've finished our game we need to 

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,797
present it to our players.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,034
One of the greatest things about Unity is that

4
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:09,326
once we have created our game we can deploy

5
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:11,326
it to many of the current platforms.

6
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:13,826
For more detailed information on building and

7
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:16,630
build targets please see the lesson linked below.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
Before we build our game we should

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,725
save our scene.

10
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:22,725
To build our game we must first open

11
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:24,725
the Build Settings window.

12
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:29,029
We can do this by selecting File - Build Settings

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,735
or by using the key combination of

14
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:34,895
shift plus command or control plus B.

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,709
This brings up the Build Settings window.

16
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:42,126
Our current build target is indicated by the Unity logo.

17
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,126
The blue highlight indicates our focus and

18
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,896
shows us on the right hand side the build

19
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,484
options for the currently selected platform.

20
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,487
We want to build to the web player.

21
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:54,904
Our current build target is PC, Mac and

22
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:56,656
Linux Standalone.

23
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,947
To change build targets, select the desired platform

24
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:02,899
from the list and click the Switch Platform button

25
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,899
at the bottom of the window.

26
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,813
Once we have selected our new build target

27
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:10,034
we need to add the scenes we want to build

28
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:12,034
to the Build Settings window.

29
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:14,351
We can add the current scene by clicking the

30
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:16,032
Add Current button.

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,032
Or we can drag and drop any scene from our

32
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,372
project view in to the field at the top of

33
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,861
the Build Settings window.

34
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,623
It's worth noting that we don't need to

35
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:26,859
include every scene in our project.

36
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,389
We only need to include the scenes we

37
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,210
we want in our game.

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,210
It is also possible to perform a build

39
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,681
with no scenes in the build Settings window.

40
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:38,093
If we do this, Unity will simply build our game

41
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:40,815
using the current scene we have open for editing.

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,781
Now we are ready to build our game.

43
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,587
Let's return to the Build Settings window

44
00:01:46,587 --> 00:01:48,421
and click the Build button.

45
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:50,421
This will bring up a dialogue box asking us

46
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,421
to choose a build location.

47
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:54,421
I like to associate my build location with

48
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,355
my project, so I will create a new folder

49
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,063
inside my project called Builds.

50
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:01,980
This folder must be placed only on the

51
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
root of our project alongside the

52
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,980
assets and library folders.

53
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,600
With the build folder selected let's name the build

54
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,241
and then click save.

55
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:16,741
Unity will now build the web player and

56
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,741
save it to our Builds folder

57
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,215
When building a web player Unity creates a

58
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:25,215
folder with the name of our game

59
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:27,704
and in that folder are 2 files.

60
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:30,492
1 is the Unity3D data file,

61
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:32,492
which contains the game data,

62
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,492
and an HTML file which holds the code

63
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:37,617
to make a webpage with our game embedded in it.

64
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:40,823
We must have both the data file and the HTML file

65
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:42,823
to run our game in a browser.

66
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:45,576
However we can write a custom HTML file

67
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:48,215
to replace the page build by Unity.

68
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:50,215
It is also possible to create a custom

69
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:53,333
web player template which Unity can use to build

70
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,333
that custom page automatically.

71
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,796
To run the game open the HTML file.

72
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,097
And now we are running a local copy of the

73
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:04,097
game in our browser.

74
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:07,522
To present this to our audience we need

75
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,522
to place both the HTML file and the

76
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,522
data file up on the internet.

77
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,257
I'm going to open an FTP client and

78
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:16,713
place the folder with both the HTML file and 

79
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:19,962
the data file in it up on my website.

80
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,155
When the folder has been uploaded we can simply

81
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,404
enter the address in to our browser

82
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,404
and play our game.

83
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:36,891
And, we win!

84
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,692
So in these assignments we have learned how to

85
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,547
create new game objects,

86
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,284
how to position them in the scene,

87
00:03:46,284 --> 00:03:47,869
add new components to them,

88
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:49,869
write our own custom behaviours for them

89
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,547
using simple scripting.

90
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,699
We've seen how to use lights, cameras,

91
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,047
colliders, triggers, rigid bodies.

92
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,253
We can collect and count objects.

93
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:00,253
Though this is a very simple example

94
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,253
it covers a large set of basic

95
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:05,526
subjects important to understanding how to use Unity.

96
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,190

1
00:00:00,994 --> 00:00:03,570
Let's begin by creating a new project.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,985
We can create a new project from File - New Project.

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:10,037
This will bring up the new project window.

4
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:11,857
The first thing we need to do is set the

5
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:14,552
destination or path to our new project.

6
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:18,283
I'm going to put this new project on my desktop.

7
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:21,428
I'm going to call the new project Roll-a-ball.

8
00:00:23,793 --> 00:00:26,025
And then I will click on Create Project

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,205
to make a new project.

10
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:31,083
We now have our new project with a new empty scene.

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,083
Before creating anything in the new scene

12
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,444
we need to save our scene.

13
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:37,662
We can save our scene by going to File - Save Scene

14
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,662
or by using the keyboard shortcut.

15
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,541
I'm going to save this scene in the Assets directory

16
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,638
in a new folder called _scenes.

17
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:49,420
The underscore is optional, I use it to sort this

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,074
folder to the top of my project window.

19
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:54,795
Now I'm going to call the scene MiniGame.

20
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:59,919
We can now see in our Scenes folder

21
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,919
the scene called MiniGame.

22
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:05,549
Let's create our game board, or play field.

23
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,383
To do this we will use a stock Unity plane.

24
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,741
We can create this plane from either

25
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:13,527
Game Object - Create Other - Plane.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,267
Or from inside the Hierarchy view using the Create menu.

27
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,457
Rename this game object Ground.

28
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:25,457
We can do this by either selecting the game object

29
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,637
and using the enter or return keys

30
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:30,145
to allow editing, or by clicking on the

31
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:32,338
game object twice, slowly.

32
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:34,712
Type in the new name or hit enter or return

33
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:36,712
to confirm this change.

34
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,914
Reset the transform component using the context

35
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:42,312
sensitive gear menu in the upper right.

36
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:44,770
This will place the game object at the location of

37
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,278
(0, 0, 0) in our scene.

38
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:49,278
This point is known as the origin point

39
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:51,650
of the world and this is where all of the

40
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,341
coordinates in the scene are calculated from.

41
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,341
Now with the game object selected and the

42
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,599
cursor over the Scene view type the F key, or choose

43
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,112
Frame Selected from the Edit menu

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,025
to see the entire game object in the Scene view.

45
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,034
We need to change the scale of the ground plane.

46
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:11,356
We can do this in a number of ways..

47
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:13,356
We can use the Scale tool,

48
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:15,714
simply grab the axis handle you want to change

49
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:18,419
and drag the handle rescaling the plane.

50
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,419
We can click and drag on the title of

51
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,419
the fields we want to change.

52
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,347
Or we can type a number directly in to the

53
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,753
field we want to change.

54
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:29,517
You can tab between fields and hit enter or return

55
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,517
to confirm your choice.

56
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:34,070
Now remember a plane has no volume

57
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,525
and scale does not work on the Y axis.

58
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,435
There will be no change unless you go in to negative numbers.

59
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:41,699
In this case the plane, which is a single

60
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,158
sided object will simply face the other direction.

61
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:47,629
If you place a plane in the scene and you can't see it

62
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,620
check your orientation between the plane and camera

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,620
and make sure that you have the correct values

64
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,287
for the Y axis of scale.

65
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:56,881
This is usually the value of 1.

66
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:59,687
Let's create our player object.

67
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,687
In this assignment our player object

68
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,687
will be a Unity sphere.

69
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:07,672
From the Hierarchy - Create menu select Sphere.

70
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:10,752
Rename the sphere Player.

71
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:15,529
Reset the transform to make sure it's a origin.

72
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,402
Select Edit - Frame Selected

73
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,402
or use the F key while the cursor is

74
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,653
over the Scene view to focus our Scene view

75
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:24,653
camera on our game object.

76
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,653
See how the sphere is buried in the plane?

77
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,653
This is because both game objects

78
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:31,237
are in the exact same location in the scene,

79
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:33,763
the origin point, or (0, 0, 0)

80
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,763
on the X, Y and Z axis.

81
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:37,763
We need to move the player's sphere up

82
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:39,763
until it rests on the plane.

83
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:44,003
All Unity primitive objects, cubes, spheres, capsules,

84
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:46,279
have a standard size, they are either

85
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:51,188
1 by 1 by 1 or 1 by 2 by 1 Unity units.

86
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,188
As such we simply lift the player object up

87
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:55,188
by half a unit in the Y axis

88
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:58,363
and we know it is laying perfectly on top of plane.

89
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:04,220
If we look in the Game view we can see it's very dark.

90
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
There are no lights in the scene.

91
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,108
Add a new directional light from the Hierarchy - Create menu.

92
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,716
Rename this Main Light.

93
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:18,838
Reset the game object's transform to Origin.

94
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:25,148
Set the X axis and the transform's rotation to 30

95
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:27,524
so it shines down on the game board.

96
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:30,404
Now this light does not give shape to the player's sphere

97
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,991
so set the transform's Y axis to 60

98
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,991
so the light comes in from 1 side.

99
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,481
This gives a better shape to the ball.

100
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:41,150
The player's position over the plane is some what ambiguous.

101
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,248
It's hard to tell the player's exact position over the plane.

102
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:45,874
Shadows will help with this.

103
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:48,823
Set the shadow type on the main light to soft shadows

104
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,927
and set the resolution to very high resolution.

105
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,745
Now it's hard to see the separation between

106
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,745
the ball and it's shadow.

107
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,745
To help with this let's add what is

108
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:00,510
called a fill light.

109
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,510
Duplicate the main light.

110
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,755
Rename Main Light to Fill Light.

111
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:13,779
Reverse the transform rotation values to -30

112
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,319
and -60.

113
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,172
so the light shines up from below but still from the front.

114
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:23,818
Change the colour value for the light

115
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:26,318
to give a hint of blue.

116
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:31,009
And lower the intensity to 0.1.

117
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,042
Finally, turn off shadows.

118
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,542
This will now act as a gentle fill light on the

119
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,942
ball separating it from it's shadow.

120
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,600
Let's look at the organisation of our hierarchy.

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Even with only 5 game objects

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
the hierarchy is already getting confusing

123
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
and is disorganised.

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Organisation in our projects and in our hierarchy

125
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,420
are very important.

126
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,583
We need to understand the organisation at a glance.

127
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,119
We organise our projects using folders or directories

128
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,119
created by our operating system.

129
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,905
We add these to our project using the

130
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,905
Project Views - Create menu.

131
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:11,141
We organise our hierarchies by using game objects.

132
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:14,671
In our scene game objects can hold other game objects.

133
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,671
Don't be afraid to use an empty game object

134
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,336
as a directory or folder in the hierarchy.

135
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:23,223
To do this, first create a new empty game object.

136
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:26,538
Rename it Lighting.

137
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,323
Reset the transform to origin,

138
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,085
and this step is important, we want the transforms of

139
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:35,085
all of our container game objects to be at

140
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:37,085
origin before we use them.

141
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,952
Add the Fill Light and the Main Light

142
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:42,638
to the lighting parent game object.

143
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,288
Now see how these lights are in the middle of the game board?

144
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:50,094
They are some what in the way.

145
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:52,094
Remember directional lights light all of the game

146
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:54,678
objects in the scene based on their rotation

147
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:56,358
not their position.

148
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:58,358
We can simply move their parent game object

149
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:01,054
up 100 units above the game board.

150
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,444
There they are, out of the way.

151
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,944
Next we will find a way to move the player game

152
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:07,944
object using player input.

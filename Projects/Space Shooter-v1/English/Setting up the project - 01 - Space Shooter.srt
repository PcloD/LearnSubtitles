1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,709
In this assignment we will create a new project,

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:06,207
import our assets, save our main scene

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,880
and set up the basic foundations for our game.

4
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,370
Let's begin by creating a brand new project.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,215
We can do this by selecting File - New Project.

6
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,116
This opens the Project Wizard.

7
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:21,199
In the Project Wizard we can open an existing

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,800
project or create a new one.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,121
We will be creating a new project.

10
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:29,461
First we need to set a location for our new project.

11
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,419
We can do this by selecting the Set button,

12
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:35,790
which brings up a Save As dialogue box.

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,018
I'm going to put this new project on my desktop.

14
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,018
I will call it Space Shooter.

15
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,789
Save this and return to the wizard.

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,969
Now if we look at the desktop

17
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,411
we will see that no files have been created.

18
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:52,312
We have simply set the path to the location

19
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:55,514
where Unity will build the new project.

20
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,680
At this stage we have the choice to import

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,081
packages of assets we have on our computer

22
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:03,250
These could be packages that came from the 

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,457
original install, packages from the asset store

24
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,139
or packages that we have saved ourselves.

25
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,139
For this assignment we want a new clean

26
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,139
empty project, so we won't select

27
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,876
any packages to import.

28
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:19,068
Click on Create Project to create this new project.

29
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:22,276
Unity will close the existing project,

30
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,429
build the project files and open the new

31
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:26,152
project in the Editor.

32
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,152
Now we are ready to go.

33
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:31,204
The next step is to import the 

34
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:32,997
assets for this project.

35
00:01:32,997 --> 00:01:34,997
Most likely you will download these from the

36
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,263
learn site and asset store.

37
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,455
When your import is ready

38
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,757
you will see a window like this one.

39
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:43,499
These are all the files we need for this project.

40
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:45,499
Make sure they are all selected.

41
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:50,240
If not click the All button in the bottom left,

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,253
then select Import to import these assets.

43
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:56,696
Unity will copy these files to our new project

44
00:01:56,696 --> 00:02:00,277
compile any scripts and import all of the assets.

45
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,647
We will be creating this project from scratch

46
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,468
using the assets provided.

47
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:11,590
If however you are confused by any step

48
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,486
this project does include a Done folder

49
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:17,944
which contains the entire project in finished form.

50
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:21,018
There is a final scene, Done_Main,

51
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:24,703
final scripts, final prefabs and more.

52
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,046
Now that we have our assets let's save

53
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,478
the scene that we will be working in.

54
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:32,443
When working in Unity we will always

55
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,068
have a scene open.

56
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:36,068
Unity opened a default scene for us

57
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,246
when we started the project.

58
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:40,246
Our current scene is unsaved.

59
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:42,953
We get a hint to remind us if our scene

60
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:45,494
has been saved if we read the header bar.

61
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,239
The header bar always lists the scene,

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,239
project name and build target.

63
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,739
Our header bar shows Untitled

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,739
which is our unsaved scene.

65
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,566
Space Shooter, our current project

66
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:00,185
and PC, Mac and Linux Standalone

67
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,185
which is our build target.

68
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,688
We will discuss build targets in a moment.

69
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:09,285
To save our scene select File - Save Scene,

70
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,285
or use the hot-key combination.

71
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,741
Scenes need to be saved in our Assets directory.

72
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,051
They can be in any directory within the Assets directory.

73
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,051
I'm going to create a new directory to hold

74
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,061
my scene, I will call this new directory

75
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,394
_Scenes.

76
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:28,011
The underscore is not necessary but I like it

77
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:30,011
as it will sort this directory to the top of

78
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,823
my project view where it will be easy to find.

79
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:36,083
Next I will name this scene Main

80
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:39,149
and hit Save to save it.

81
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,926
We can see that we now have a directory called

82
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:45,359
_Scenes and a scene file called Main.

83
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,359
We can also see Main as the

84
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,359
scene listed in the header bar.

85
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,983
Now that we have imported our assets and

86
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:55,299
saved our scene we need to set our build target.

87
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,299
Whenever we are working on a project we are

88
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,299
always working with a build target.

89
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,047
Our current build target is the default

90
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,747
PC, Mac and Linux Standalone.

91
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:07,306
All of our assets will be imported for this target

92
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:09,306
and all of our scripts will be compiled

93
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:11,893
for this target, so it's important to have our

94
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:15,441
build settings set to the intended target platform.

95
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:18,107
Don't forget Unity can have one project

96
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,948
and one codebase for all of our build targets

97
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,563
and most of what we develop will work

98
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,485
for all platforms, but we will be developing

99
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:27,875
for only one platform at a time.

100
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:31,422
To set our build target we can select

101
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:35,208
File - Build Settings, or use the hot-key combination.

102
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,551
This will bring up the Build Settings window.

103
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:41,534
Here we can set the details of our build

104
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:44,651
and select the scenes we want to build in to our game.

105
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,745
We want to change the build target to

106
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,745
Web Player, as we will be building and

107
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,104
deploying this project to the web.

108
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:56,052
Click on Web Player to select the web player build target.

109
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:59,535
The blue highlight indicates we have selected the Web Player.

110
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:02,414
We can see the details on the right change,

111
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:05,142
but we have not changed the build target.

112
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:07,142
Our current build target is indicated by the

113
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,569
Unity logo and is shown in the header bar.

114
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,450
To change build targets select the

115
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,781
platform you want and click Switch Platform.

116
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,110
Now the Unity logo is associated with 

117
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,774
our new build target, and that new build

118
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,774
target is listed in the header.

119
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,267
Now that we have set our build target we need to set

120
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,267
the build details for our game.

121
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,767
We can do this from the Build Settings window

122
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,572
by selecting Player Settings.

123
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:40,033
This allows us to inspect and change our player settings.

124
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,533
If we want to change our player settings and the

125
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,003
build window is not open we can select

126
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:47,806
Edit - Project Settings - Player.

127
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:52,110
With Player Settings open in the Inspector

128
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,412
we can change both project-wide settings

129
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,412
and platform-specific settings.

130
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:58,912
For more information on player settings

131
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:00,912
see the details linked below.

132
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:03,716
For this project we can leave everything at

133
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:06,316
default except Resolution.

134
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,316
I would like this Space Shooter game to have

135
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,815
the feeling of an upright arcade game,

136
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,118
portrait rather than landscape,

137
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:19,403
so let's change the resolution to 600 by 900.

138
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,630
So that we can see an accurate representation

139
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,630
of our game let's make sure that

140
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,129
the aspect ratio in the Game view

141
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,018
is set to Web.

142
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:32,018
This will use the 600 by 900 

143
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,018
size and aspect ratio.

144
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,722
With this size and aspect ratio however

145
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:39,722
I do notice that the game view looks cramped

146
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,997
and small in it's window.

147
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,997
I'm not sure this is how I want to view my game

148
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:45,552
as I develop.

149
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:49,001
The solution to this is easy, change the layout.

150
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,611
I'm going to grab the Game view tab and drag

151
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,994
it up to the top between the Scene view and Console.

152
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:57,494
This will give me a big easy to read view

153
00:06:57,494 --> 00:07:01,240
of my scene, game and console.

154
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,083
Undoubtedly you will have a different layout.

155
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,997
but be aware that changing the layout is easy

156
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:10,765
Now that I've changed the layout let's save it.

157
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,750
If we don't save our layouts and we reselect

158
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,346
the current layout our layout will return

159
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,968
to the last saved configuration.

160
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:22,771
To save the layout select Layout and choose

161
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:24,285
Save Layout.

162
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,679
Either save over the current layout to update it

163
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,372
or choose a new name for a new layout.

164
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:32,897
I'm going to create a new layout and I'm going to

165
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:34,897
call it Space Shooter.

166
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,303
Now that I've changed my layout I can return to

167
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:41,303
this one by simply selecting it from the

168
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,303
Layout pull-down menu.

169
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:45,303
That's it for setting up this project.

170
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,983
Now that we've setup the project, in the next

171
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:51,321
assignment we will setup the main player game object.

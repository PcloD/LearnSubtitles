1
00:00:01,202 --> 00:00:03,044
In this assignment we will setup the camera

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,323
and lighting for our game.

3
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:07,918
Our game will be a top-down style game

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:09,918
where we are looking down on the game area

5
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:12,429
from a fixed position above the game.

6
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:16,324
If we switch to the Game view we can see

7
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,200
that the camera is in a completely different

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,155
position from where it needs to be for our game

9
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,627
When we look at the main camera in the Scene view

10
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,627
we can see that it is behind the player

11
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:30,921
game object and slightly above it.

12
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:33,224
This is the default starting position for the

13
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:35,224
main camera in a new scene.

14
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:38,004
Unity will always include a default main

15
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,218
camera at this position in every new scene.

16
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:44,353
At this point it's worth noting that in the

17
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:47,102
Scene view, when we have a camera selected

18
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:49,102
we can see a preview for that camera in the

19
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:51,102
lower right of the Scene view.

20
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,776
So we want to move the camera to

21
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,776
a position above the game area

22
00:00:56,776 --> 00:00:58,776
where it is looking down on the game.

23
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,193
Don't forget that the camera is simply a

24
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:03,193
camera component attached to a game

25
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,042
object in our scene.

26
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,042
We can manipulate the camera in our scene

27
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:09,796
by effecting the camera's transform.

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,119
First let's reset the camera's transform

29
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,004
by using Reset on the context sensitive gear menu.

30
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:20,504
This will reset the transform values and

31
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,504
set the camera to the origin point with

32
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:24,977
no rotation and a scale of 1.

33
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,191
With the camera at origin let's rotate it

34
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,594
to face down by adjusting the rotation

35
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:33,336
on the X axis to 90 degrees.

36
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:36,947
Next let's grab the transform

37
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:39,113
by using the transform handles

38
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:41,569
and lift it up along the Y axis.

39
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,429
We can see how the camera preview is updating

40
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,952
to show what the camera is rendering

41
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,358
For our game we can simply change

42
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,358
the Y value to 10,

43
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:56,673
placing the camera 10 units above the player ship.

44
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,902
Now that the camera is in place, let's setup

45
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,595
the camera component.

46
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,095
The first decision we need to make is about

47
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:05,819
the camera type.

48
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,267
Will our projection be perspective or orthographic?

49
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:13,719
Our game needs to feel like an upright arcade game.

50
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,719
These did not have any perspective

51
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,504
so we will choose orthographic as our projection mode.

52
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,501
When we are using a perspective camera

53
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,501
if we want to change how much of our game

54
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,955
the camera sees we can adjust the

55
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,607
field of view value.

56
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,373
This is a lot like changing the zoom on a 

57
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,277
real world camera.

58
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,277
The larger the field of view, the wider

59
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,470
the lens as it were,

60
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,042
and the more our camera can see and render.

61
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,820
When we are using an orthographic camera

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,098
we can adjust how much the camera will see

63
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,756
by changing the orthographic size.

64
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:49,584
But what is the correct size for our game?

65
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:51,584
We can see a fairly reasonable representation

66
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:54,044
of the camera in the preview window.

67
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:56,044
But it might be better to do any final 

68
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:58,044
adjustments in the Game view itself.

69
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,621
We will still have control over the component

70
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,621
in the Inspector and we can see the

71
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,024
actual camera output full size.

72
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,964
It seems that the ship feels right when the

73
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,341
orthographic size is around 10.

74
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,285
So let's set that value to around 10 exactly.

75
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,976
Now the player is in the exact centre of the game area.

76
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:20,571
I feel that the ship should start

77
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,751
near the bottom of the screen.

78
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,877
What's the best way to do this?

79
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,376
We could switch back in to the Scene view

80
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,985
and move the ship by dragging the ship's

81
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,853
transform handles, but we have no good feedback

82
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,853
from the Game view or the camera to know if

83
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:35,853
we have chosen the correct position.

84
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,684
We could change our layout so we have both

85
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:41,607
the Game and the Scene view open at the same time.

86
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,607
But we don't need to.

87
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,412
Let's switch back to the Game view

88
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:47,775
and move the ship while we are able to see it

89
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:50,401
in the full sized Game view window.

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
We will need to move the ship by directly

91
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,257
manipulating the ship's transform component.

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,372
We want to move the ship along the Z axis,

93
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,191
so click on the Field title,

94
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,325
in this case the Z,

95
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,200
and drag back and forth until the ship

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
looks correct in the scene.

97
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,708
Now we have a problem.

98
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,472
We really want the player's game object

99
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,361
to be at origin. 

100
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:16,361
We want this for 2 reasons.

101
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,361
1, it just feels better to me.

102
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:21,290
And 2, it will make certain steps

103
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,001
later on in this project easier to manage.

104
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,769
Yet I still want to have the player's ship 

105
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,468
start down here at the bottom of the game area.

106
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:32,313
Well as we know, all things are relative.

107
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,966
So let's move the camera, not the player.

108
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:38,245
Reset the ship's transform back to origin

109
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,147
and select the main camera.

110
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,508
Again, by dragging the Field title,

111
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:46,193
move the camera's transform up along the Z axis

112
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:48,739
until the ship is in a good position.

113
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,728
This feels like a good position for the player's ship.

114
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,255
Let's clean up the value for the camera's

115
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,255
transform Z axis.

116
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,853
A clean round 5 is good.

117
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:03,933
Next let's set the camera's background.

118
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,933
Currently we have the default background

119
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,933
found in the Clear Flag setting.

120
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:11,166
This is Skybox.

121
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,401
We won't be using a skybox today,

122
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,911
we simply want a black background.

123
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:18,160
So let's change the clear flags

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,953
to solid colour.

125
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:22,577
It's worth noting that if our clear flags

126
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,331
is set to Skybox and we have no

127
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,229
skybox assigned clear flags will use the

128
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,312
background colour instead.

129
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:33,408
This is why, even though we have skybox selected,

130
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,737
we see the blue from the background colour.

131
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:38,734
Click on the colour box. 

132
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,081
This will bring up a colour picker.

133
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,081
Let's make our background black.

134
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,412
When we are done we can close the colour picker.

135
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:48,728
We have no lights in this scene.

136
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,327
Our background is black, yet we can still

137
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,235
see our player ship. Why is that?

138
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,232
If we go to Edit - Render Settings

139
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:01,831
we can see a property called Ambient Light.

140
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,455
Ambient Light is the light from

141
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:06,455
no fixed point that lights all

142
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:08,455
the surfaces in the scene.

143
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:11,160
All new scenes have an ambient light set to

144
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,781
(51, 51, 51).

145
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,781
So every new scene has a very

146
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:19,544
dim ambient light added to all objects in that scene.

147
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,376
These values can be adjusted to add

148
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,583
a general colour or full white light

149
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,583
to all objects in the scene.

150
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,083
However, this light has no directionality

151
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,125
and it can be very unflattering if used incorrectly.

152
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,688
We will set our ambient light to Black,

153
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,688
effectively turning it off.

154
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:42,835
Now let's light our scene.

155
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,344
We will be creating a modified 3 point lighting

156
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:48,999
system for our game with a main or key light,

157
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,800
a fill light and a rim light.

158
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
These three lights will show off the shapes of

159
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,442
our objects and give our game a

160
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:57,051
good sense of atmosphere.

161
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:01,589
Start by selecting Create - Directional Light

162
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,173
from the Create menu in the Hierarchy view.

163
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,669
This will add a directional light to our scene

164
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:11,340
Rename this game object Main Light.

165
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:14,991
Next let's reset the light's position.

166
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,112
This will set the light to origin.

167
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,112
We won't see any change in the lighting

168
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:22,781
as directional lights light the entire scene

169
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:25,696
based on their rotation, not their position.

170
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:29,424
Switching back to the Scene view will show us the light

171
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:31,424
and the gizmo will show us it's

172
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,424
orientation in the scene.

173
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,670
Let's now reset the rotation as well,

174
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,449
so we can have a clean set of values to start from.

175
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:42,308
This is our main light, so it will be the

176
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,570
brightest and most important.

177
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,194
We need to see the light on the ship

178
00:07:46,194 --> 00:07:49,423
from our main camera, which is above the player.

179
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:51,423
So let's tilt the main light down on to

180
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,423
the scene, but not too much.

181
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,630
We want to see the shape of the ship,

182
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,201
but not wash it out.

183
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:00,843
That looks good. It's nearly at 20 degrees.

184
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,843
So let's clean up that value to around

185
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,399
20 degrees down in to the scene.

186
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:10,611
Now let's rotate the light around on it's Y axis

187
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,611
and bring the light in from the side.

188
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:15,321
Let's pick a good point towards the front

189
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,085
but not directly in front.

190
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,364
It feels good about here.

191
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:23,479
Let's clean up these values to around -115.

192
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,054
To see how this light works in our game

193
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:28,054
let's switch back to the Game view.

194
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,824
We want the main light to feel like the light

195
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:34,416
from a nearby sun, so let's increase the

196
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,064
intensity to 0.75.

197
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,155
This gives a nice hot feeling to

198
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,861
the right side of the ship.

199
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:43,462
We could change the colour, but let's

200
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:46,129
leave the main light at white for now.

201
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:49,675
This lighting might seem realistic for some

202
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:52,229
deep space environment but the other side

203
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:55,205
of the ship is far too dark for this game.

204
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:58,184
To light this side of the ship we need another light.

205
00:08:58,184 --> 00:09:00,611
This will be our fill light, to fill in the

206
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,611
shadows on the far side.

207
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:06,076
To build our fill light duplicate the main light.

208
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,923
Make sure the main light is selected

209
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,222
and then use Edit - Duplicate

210
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:13,722
or use the hot-key combination.

211
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:18,248
Rename the duplicate Fill Light.

212
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,433
These 2 lights are now doubling up on the same

213
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:25,015
surfaces as the lights add together.

214
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:27,432
Don't worry, we'll soon change this.

215
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,807
First, let's reset the rotation on the fill light

216
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,807
and then switch to the Scene view so we can see

217
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,807
the gizmo on the light.

218
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,888
We could set this light by eye in the Game view

219
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,888
but it can also be helpful to see the light's

220
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:42,888
gizmo when making adjustments.

221
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,844
Let's grab the fill light and rotate it around

222
00:09:45,844 --> 00:09:47,526
on the Y axis.

223
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:50,731
Here we want to light the other side of the ship.

224
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:52,731
Also from a direction in front of the ship

225
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:54,731
to compliment the key light.

226
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,231
This feels good.

227
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,767
Let's look at the lighting in the Game view.

228
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,846
The direction of the fill light looks good

229
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,912
but it's feeling like we now have 2 main lights.

230
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,759
We don't need 2 main lights,

231
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,281
so let's reduce the intensity of the fill light

232
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,435
down to 0.5.

233
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:15,931
And let's change the colour as well

234
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:19,549
A hint of blue will tell us that this is a secondary light.

235
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:22,597
Let's reduce the red channel to 128

236
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:25,097
and then let's also reduce the values of

237
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:27,268
the green and blue channels as well,

238
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,611
down to about 192.

239
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,746
Generally darkening our fill colour.

240
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,647
By toggling the fill light we can see how it's

241
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,647
lighting that side of the ship.

242
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:41,192
Lastly, let's tilt down a little in to the scene,

243
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:42,748
5 degrees is enough,

244
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:45,624
and let's clean up the rotation on the Y axis,

245
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:50,035
making it a nice round 125. That looks good.

246
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,281
Now let's add the rim light.

247
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:58,086
Duplicate the fill light and rename it Rim Light.

248
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,564
So we can see our rim light,

249
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,192
which will be fairly subtle,

250
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,053
let's turn off the fill light.

251
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:08,244
Now select the rim light and reset the

252
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,782
transform to remove the rotational values.

253
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,973
This rim light needs to be fairly clear

254
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,973
and it needs to stand out when mixing in

255
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,973
with the fill light, so let's change the

256
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:19,973
colour to pure white.

257
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,209
Now we want to light the rear of the ship

258
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,542
in a way that compliments the fill light.

259
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,693
So let's rotate the light around to catch

260
00:11:27,693 --> 00:11:29,261
the rear edges of the ship,

261
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:31,261
but on the same side as the fill.

262
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,620
This looks good.

263
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,898
Let's make this value a clean 65 degrees.

264
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,898
This shows the edge well, but it's also

265
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:43,724
acting now like a second fill light.

266
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:46,224
This is mostly due to how much light

267
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:48,527
spills on to the top of the ship.

268
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:51,476
To fix this let's rotate the light on the X axis

269
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,724
and come up from below.

270
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,932
Now this may seem counter intuitive,

271
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,198
as we are looking down on the ship,

272
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,198
but this will keep the light from shining on the top

273
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,198
surface of the ship and it will still

274
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:04,699
catch the edges that we need to light.

275
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,279
-15 degrees seems fine.

276
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:13,560
Lastly, let's drop the intensity down to 0.25.

277
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,138
This may seem overly subtle

278
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,688
but when we add the fill light back in

279
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,466
we can see that they add together to give

280
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,814
us a good rim light and fill.

281
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,983
Now that we have added our lights to the hierarchy

282
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,983
they are sorted alphabetically and mixed in

283
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,483
with all of the other game objects.

284
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,483
This is not very well organised.

285
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:40,681
If we look in to our Scene view and select our new lights

286
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,681
the gizmos appear right where we are working

287
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,463
on top of our ship in the middle of the scene.

288
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:49,745
Let's add some organisation to our scene.

289
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:53,802
We can organise our scene by using empty game object.

290
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:57,143
Add a new empty game object to the scene using the hot-key.

291
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,101
Use shift-command-N on the mac

292
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:03,009
and shift-control-N on windows.

293
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:06,407
Rename this Lighting.

294
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:10,510
Reset the game object's transform.

295
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,010
It's important to note this step

296
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
When we are using empty game objects

297
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,510
to organise our hierarchy

298
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,264
those game objects should be at origin

299
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:22,802
with no rotation and a scale of 1.

300
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:25,190
This can be accomplished by simply

301
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,190
resetting the transform component.

302
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,548
Now that we have setup our lighting game object

303
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,548
we can drag our lights in to it.

304
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:34,548
This organises our hierarchy and keeps

305
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,674
our lights together.

306
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,674
To clean up the gizmos at origin

307
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:41,049
we can move our lighting parent game object

308
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:44,057
up on the Y axis to get it out of the way.

309
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:47,372
Let's move them up by 100 units.

310
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,343
Now, there they are, up there out of the way.

311
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:53,675
We can move these lights like this because

312
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:55,841
they are directional lights

313
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,201
and directional lights light the entire scene

314
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:00,090
based on their transform's rotation

315
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,090
not their position.

316
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:05,699
This sets up our camera and our lighting.

317
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,344
In the next assignment we will create

318
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,344
a background for our game.

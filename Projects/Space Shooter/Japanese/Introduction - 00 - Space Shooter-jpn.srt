00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:15,726
 Welcome to the Space Shooter project.

2
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,726
In this project we will build this

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,026
top down arcade style shooter.

4
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,811
In the foundation assignments we will

5
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,773
import the assets we need,

6
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,984
setup our base project and set the

7
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,984
build target for our game.

8
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,865
We will then setup the basic player game object,

9
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:36,105
preparing it to move, shoot and interact

10
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:38,105
with the other objects in the scene.

11
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,134
To prepare the scene we will setup

12
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,565
the camera, lights and background.

13
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,912
We will show how to setup game object,

14
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:51,912
attach pre-made components,

15
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:54,673
and use our models and artwork in our scene.

16
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,550
With our scene setup we will write simple

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,550
custom code in C#

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,838
to capture the player's input and use it

19
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,838
to move our player's ship.

20
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:09,491
We will create lazerbolts for our player to shoot.

21
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:11,347
We will create asteroid hazards 

22
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:13,347
to challenge our player.

23
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:17,826
We will write a game controller to control out game,

24
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:20,251
spawn our hazards in waves,

25
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:22,615
count and display our score and manage

26
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:26,243
how we end and when we can restart our game.

27
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:31,304
We will add audio effects and a background music track.

28
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,681
Finally we will build and deploy the game to the web.

29
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,857
In more advanced lessons and live sessions

30
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:43,619
we will use this project for further learning,

31
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,369
where we will add enemy ships,

32
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,758
scroll the background and add the star field and more.

33
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:54,265
To get started begin with Assignment 1 - Setting Up The Game.

1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:02,563
In this assignment we will begin work

2
00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:05,665
on the lift by creating a set of double doors.

3
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,665
The lift will have inner and outer doors

4
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,665
and the inner doors will track the motion

5
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:10,834
of the outer doors.

6
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:13,152
Here we will setup the motion of the

7
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,152
outer doors and write code that will

8
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:17,152
apply to the lift's inner doors that we

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,152
will add in the next assignment.

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,152
The double doors of the lift will work in

11
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:23,152
a similar way to the single doors we

12
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:25,152
have already made, but with some

13
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:26,918
subtle differences.

14
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:28,918
We will start as before by dragging the

15
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:30,918
model in to the scene.

16
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:33,877
In the Models folder locate

17
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:36,375
door_exitOuter and drag it in to

18
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,891
the Scene view.

19
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:42,607
Position it at (-22, 0, 46).

20
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,710
And rotate it by 270 in the Y axis.

21
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:51,080
Double click it's name in the hierarchy 

22
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,192
to focus the Scene view on it.

23
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:54,885
You should now see that it's located

24
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:55,927
inside the lift shaft. 

25
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:57,927
Before we go any further let's enable

26
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,346
light probes on both the left and right door

27
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:03,423
so that they are affected by the lighting in our scene.

28
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:05,423
Open the hierarchy and select both

29
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:08,006
doors then under the Mesh Renderer component

30
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,006
check Use Light Probes.

31
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:12,506
Next, as with our single door, 

32
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,506
we need to add box colliders to each of

33
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:16,506
the doors and a sphere trigger collider

34
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,506
to the parent object.

35
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:21,681
Select the parent object and choose

36
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,877
Add Component - Physics - Sphere Collider

37
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,502
and check the Is Trigger box.

38
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,724
Then select both child door objects

39
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:36,926
and choose Add Component - Physics - Box Collider

40
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:39,274
We want the proportions and the position

41
00:01:39,274 --> 00:01:41,274
of the trigger collider to be slightly different

42
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,980
to the single doors.

43
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,718
This is because we want the doors to shut

44
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,602
behind the player character when they enter the lift.

45
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:49,602
Reselect the parent object

46
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:51,602
and in the Sphere Collider component

47
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:55,751
set the centre to (-1, 1, 0)

48
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,751
and set the radius to 2.

49
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,165
Now we need to create an animator

50
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:03,208
controller asset to control the double doors.

51
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,208
It should be exactly the same as the single

52
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,208
door animator controller but with the

53
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,958
animations for the double doors instead.

54
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,958
As such we can duplicate the single

55
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,291
door animator that we made earlier

56
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,903
and rename the duplicate to DoubleDoorAnimator.

57
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:20,501
Open the Animators folder in the Project panel

58
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,276
and duplicate the SingleDoorAnimator.

59
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,276
You can use the shortcut command-D

60
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,276
or control-D on PC

61
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:29,276
or go to Edit - Duplicate.

62
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,797
Then rename this DoubleDoorAnimator.

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Now all we need to do is edit the animations

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,519
that the states represent.

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,314
Ensure that you can see your Animator window

66
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,277
and then change the SingleDoorOpen animation

67
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:46,069
to the DoubleDoorOpen animation

68
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,916
and likewise for the closed.

69
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,039
To do this select the open state

70
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,039
in the Animator window and then in the

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,205
Models folder in the project panel

72
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:58,434
expand the door_exitOuter FPX

73
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:00,218
so that you can see the open and closed

74
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:02,218
animations beneath it.

75
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:06,791
Drop the door_exitOuter_open animation

76
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,413
on to the motion field in the Inspector

77
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:10,971
for the open state.

78
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,692
Then select the closed state

79
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:16,205
and drag door_exitOuter_closed

80
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:18,205
to the motion field for this state.

81
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:21,107
We can now apply the animator controller

82
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:23,024
to the animator component.

83
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:26,448
Reselect door_exitOuter in the hierarchy

84
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:28,669
and drag the DoubleDoorAnimator

85
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,669
from the Animators folder in the project

86
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,392
to the controller property of the

87
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:33,590
animator component.

88
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,590
We also need to make sure that Root Motion

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,694
is not applied, so uncheck this box.

90
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,387
As with the single doors we need to add

91
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,387
a kinematic rigidbody component

92
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:45,387
to the moving parts.

93
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:49,020
Select both the exitOuter_left and right doors

94
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:54,257
and go to Add Component - Physics - RigidBody.

95
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:58,745
Uncheck Use Gravity and check Is Kinematic.

96
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,745
Now we can apply the door animation script

97
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:03,370
that we wrote earlier to the parent object.

98
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,870
Select door_exitOuter

99
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,494
and then in the Scripts folder

100
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,610
under Level Dynamics drag and drop

101
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,652
DoorAnimation either in to the Inspector

102
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,652
beneath the other components or on the

103
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:19,652
name of the object in the hierarchy.

104
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:21,209
We need to make sure that the correct

105
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,442
audio clips are applied

106
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:26,832
so in the Audio folder drag and drop

107
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,832
door_open to Door Swish Clip

108
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,611
and door_accessDenied to Access Denied Clip

109
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:35,261
and also that this door requires a key.

110
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,261
by checking the Require Key public variable

111
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,261
in the Inspector.

112
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,261
As with the single doors, for these doors

113
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,944
we will need to add an audio source component

114
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:46,661
and make sure that Play On Awake is unchecked.

115
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,396
Click Add Component and choose

116
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:52,954
Audio - Audio Source and uncheck Play On Awake.

117
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,837
The doors are now ready to be stored as a prefab.

118
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,837
Do so by dragging the parent object from

119
00:04:57,837 --> 00:04:59,837
the hierarchy in to the Prefabs folder

120
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:01,837
in the Project panel.

121
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,337
The last thing we will do in this assignment

122
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,337
is to make a script that will make the inner

123
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,337
doors of the lift move with the outer

124
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,337
doors that we have just made.

125
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,824
We will call it LiftDoorsTracking.

126
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:15,349
However we are not going to apply it to the doors,

127
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,349
instead we will be applying it to the lift

128
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,198
that we will make later.

129
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:22,031
Select the Scripts folder in the Project panel

130
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,514
and then select Level Dynamics.

131
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:27,482
Click Create and choose C# script.

132
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,158
Name the script LiftDoorsTracking

133
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,893
Launch the script for editing

134
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:36,393
and then prepare it as usual.

135
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,893
In this script we are going to make the inner

136
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:41,905
doors lag just slightly behind the outer doors.

137
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:44,534
As such we will need a variable that we can tweak

138
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:47,260
for how fast the inner doors will catch up.

139
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:50,436
We will set this to a default of 7.

140
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:52,228
We also need to store the transform

141
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,228
of each of our doors.

142
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:59,353
The last class variables we will need

143
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,353
are floats, in which we can store the

144
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,353
X component of the position the doors

145
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:05,655
are in when they are closed.

146
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,891
We will use this to force them to close

147
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,891
when the lift is about to leave.

148
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,999
Next we can use the awake function to

149
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,693
allocate our references. 

150
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,985
We are going to use GameObject.Find

151
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,440
rather than tagging each door separately.

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,799
At this point it becomes obvious why a strong

153
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,799
naming convention is advised.

154
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,618
We know that our double doors have names like

155
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,010
door_exitOuter_left_001.

156
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,010
Using our naming convention we know that

157
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,382
the inner doors, those attached to the lift

158
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:37,055
will be named door_exitInner_left_001 for the left

159
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,055
and likewise for the right.

160
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,922
We also need to set the closed X positions.

161
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,922
Since the doors will start off closed

162
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:49,938
we can setup these variables in the Awake function.

163
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,129
We need a function that will move the doors

164
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,630
based on a target X coordinate.

165
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,340
We will need a float argument for each

166
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,340
of the left and right doors that will

167
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,129
be parsed to this function when it is called.

168
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,968
We will call this function MoveDoors.

169
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:08,573
Normally when we want to smoothly transition

170
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:10,573
from one position to another we'd use

171
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:13,453
Vector3.Lerp and therefore modify the 

172
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:15,453
X, Y and Z coordinates.

173
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,453
But since we want the inner doors to also move

174
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,453
up with the lifts we're only going

175
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:23,161
to lerp their X coordinate using Mathf.Lerp.

176
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,161
We will then simply parse in the existing

177
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,682
Y and Z coordinates in to the Vector3

178
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:29,475
for the new position.

179
00:07:29,475 --> 00:07:31,475
We will use this Mathf.Lerp on a 

180
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,185
new float variable.

181
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,643
Firstly we will set the left inner door.

182
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,074
We then set the position of the door to a

183
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:41,199
Vector3 with the newly offset X coordinate.

184
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,145
and the existing Y and Z coordinates.

185
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:47,854
Next we can reassign this new X variable

186
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:50,854
for the right inner door's new X coordinate.

187
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:53,989
And with this we can set the right inner

188
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,989
door's position.

189
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,793
With the function complete we need a couple

190
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:00,793
of ways of calling it.

191
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:02,793
Both these functions should be public

192
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,793
since they will be called from the lift

193
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:07,123
triggering script that we will write later.

194
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,473
We need one function to call the MoveDoors function

195
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,473
with the parameter of the outer door's X

196
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:15,599
positions so that the inner doors will follow them.

197
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,599
The other function we will need we'll call

198
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,585
MoveDoors with the parameters of the closed

199
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,585
X positions for when the player is

200
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,585
inside the lift, and it must close

201
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,918
to seal them inside.

202
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,918
We will start with the function that makes

203
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,321
the inner doors follow the outer doors.

204
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,321
We will call this DoorFollowing.

205
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,821
All we need to do in this function is

206
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,821
to call MoveDoors with the outer doors

207
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:38,864
X positions as parameters.

208
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,151
Next we will make the function CloseDoors

209
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:46,151
which we'll call MoveDoors with the closed

210
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,151
X coordinates.

211
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:51,438
The script is now finished and in the next

212
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:54,078
assignment we will attach it to the lift.

213
00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:56,078
For now save your script and

214
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,078
reutrn to the editor.

215
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:00,578
Remember to save your scene

216
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,822
and save your project.

217
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,822
In the next assignment we will be finishing off

218
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:08,142
this chapter by creating the lift

219
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,244
through which the player completes the level.

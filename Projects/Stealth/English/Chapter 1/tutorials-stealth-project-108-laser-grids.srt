1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
In this assignment we'll create the laser grids

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:04,245
that also trigger the alarm if the player

3
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:04,954
crosses them. 

4
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:06,954
First we can see that in the last assignment

5
00:00:06,954 --> 00:00:08,788
We created some scripts using the

6
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:10,357
Add Component button,

7
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,605
which are left in the root of our assets.

8
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:14,357
So let's tidy these up by dropping them

9
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,357
in to the Scripts folder.

10
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,086
Now let's start making the laser grids.

11
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,086
We're going to add a model to the scene,

12
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:24,692
add some components, write some scripts

13
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,692
and then turn this in to a prefab so that

14
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,692
we can make several laser gates.

15
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:31,137
In the Models folder, locate

16
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,773
FX - Laser Fence - Lasers.

17
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:36,035
Drag and drop this in to the scene

18
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:37,608
somewhere like this.

19
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,329
Press F to focus on it.

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,718
We'll start by changing the rotation by

21
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:45,036
ninety degrees in the Y axis.

22
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:48,296
This will rotate it to face the two gate

23
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:50,296
points on either side of the corridor.

24
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:55,979
Then we'll change the scale to (1, 1, 3.62).

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:04,063
We'll set the position to (-8, 1.21, 5.62)

26
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:08,743
This should place your first laser gat in to

27
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:10,897
the exact position that we have on scene.

28
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:13,104
To make it easier to keep track of these

29
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:15,104
lasers we're going to add a number

30
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,104
as a post-fix to the name.

31
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:22,598
So rename this '_001' at the end

32
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,931
The laser grid needs to be able to detect

33
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,779
when the player passes through it

34
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,112
and so it needs a trigger collider.

35
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:32,088
For efficiency we're going to use a box collider.

36
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:34,088
The collider will automatically resize to

37
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,682
the laser grid when we add it.

38
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:37,112
We just need to make sure that the

39
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:39,002
Is Trigger box is checked.

40
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:40,892
So click Add Component

41
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,114
choose Physics - Box Collider

42
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:45,614
and then check Is Trigger.

43
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:48,487
You'll be able to see a faint green outline

44
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:50,349
that shows the bounding area

45
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:51,749
of the box collider.

46
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:53,749
We're also going to add an audio source 

47
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,749
component so that the player can hear

48
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,113
a faint laser hum when he's near them.

49
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:00,404
Click Add Component and choose

50
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,404
Audio - Audio Source.

51
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:05,471
In the Audio folder drag and drop

52
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,041
the Laser Hum clip on to the audio clip

53
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,041
in the Audio Source component.

54
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,889
You should see that this is a 3D sound.

55
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,889
which means the proximity of the listener

56
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:17,140
will define how loud it is to the player.

57
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,604
We want to make sure that the player can

58
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,883
hear the hum from a reasonable distance

59
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:23,202
so underneath 3d Sound Settings

60
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:26,348
set the minimum distance to 1.8.

61
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:30,178
You'll see that the spherical representation

62
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:32,372
of this expands in the Scene View.

63
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:34,206
We also want to make sure that this clip

64
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,664
loops throughout the game so check the

65
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:39,469
Loop checkbox on the audio source component.

66
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,261
We also want the lasers to have a slight

67
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,261
red glow. To do this we're going 

68
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,261
to have a point light attached to them.

69
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:48,092
Collapse your components to make room

70
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:52,530
and click Add Component - Rendering - Light.

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,530
Now we'll change the colour to red

72
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,127
to match the laser grid.

73
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:58,438
Click the Colour Picker and copy

74
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:00,202
these colour settings

75
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:03,495
(255, 40, 0).

76
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,371
We need to tweak the settings slightly

77
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,012
for the lights.

78
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,012
Change the range to 5

79
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:13,152
and the intensity to 0.6.

80
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:15,357
We also want to make sure that when we

81
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,357
re-bake the light map these lights

82
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,357
are not included, because otherwise

83
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:21,357
when the laser grids are switched off

84
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:22,918
the light from them would remain

85
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,918
on the surface of the environment.

86
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,724
To correct this make sure that these are

87
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:28,431
realtime only lights.

88
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,075
Set Light Mapping to Realtime Only.

89
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:34,861
Now we need two scripts for the laser grid.

90
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,419
The first script will make the lasers

91
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,265
blink on and off, we will call it

92
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,577
Laser Blinking.

93
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,271
Click the Add Component button and choose

94
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:44,046
New Script and name it LaserBlinking

95
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,363
Double click the icon to launch for editing.

96
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,278
Begin by clearing the script as usual.

97
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:52,944
We only need a few class variables for

98
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:55,375
this script, two public floats for the

99
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,935
amount of time the lasers are on and off,

100
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,935
and a float for a timer to know when to

101
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:01,935
switch between on and off.

102
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:04,711
To make the laser blink we're going to

103
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,565
disable and enable the laser's

104
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:09,832
renderer component and it's light component.

105
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,579
Thus we need to check if the renderer is enabled

106
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,398
and the timer is greater than or equal

107
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:16,287
to the amount of time that the laser is

108
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,135
supposed to be on.

109
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:20,993
We will do this inside the update function.

110
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,492
So add one now.

111
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,645
First we'll increment the timer.

112
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:28,145
Then we'll check if the renderer is enabled

113
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:30,145
and that the timer is more than or

114
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,145
equal to onTime.

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,727
If these conditions are satisfied then

116
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:36,603
we need to switch whether the beam is

117
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,909
on or not and reset the timer.

118
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,413
We will do this in a short separate function.

119
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,493
First we will reset the timer

120
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,993
and then we simply set the enabled status

121
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:48,993
of the renderer and the lights

122
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:50,993
to the opposite of themselves.

123
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,220
With that short function finished we can

124
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,935
now put a call to it inside our update function

125
00:04:57,935 --> 00:04:59,935
inside the brackets of the If statement.

126
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:02,667
To finish the script we also need the

127
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,667
opposite check for if the renderer is

128
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,667
already disabled.

129
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:11,072
The script is now complete, so save it

130
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:13,072
and return to the editor.

131
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:14,902
Now we need another script to

132
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:16,557
manage player detection.

133
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:19,502
We'll call this script Laser PlayerDetection.

134
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,972
Click Add Component and choose New Script,

135
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,711
naming it LaserPlayerDetection.

136
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:27,360
Double click the icon to open it for editing.

137
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:30,081
Clear the script as usual.

138
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:33,603
This script doesn't need to be referenced elsewhere,

139
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:35,075
nor does it have anything that needs

140
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,521
tweaking publicly. As such we don't need

141
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:39,521
any public class variables.

142
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,259
It does however need a couple of private

143
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,259
variables to store references.

144
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,509
The first is to the Player game object.

145
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,054
The other is a reference to the last

146
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:49,261
LastPlayerSighting script.

147
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:51,261
We will use the Awake function to setup

148
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:53,776
these references using FindGameObjectWithTag

149
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,776
as we have done before.

150
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:05,969
The only other function we need in this script

151
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,969
is OnTriggerStay.

152
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:12,415
We need to know if the renderer is enabled first

153
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,415
since the lasers should only be detecting

154
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,415
when they are on.

155
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:19,371
Given that the lasers are on we need

156
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,371
to check if the colliding game object is

157
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,371
indeed the player.

158
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:26,437
If it is the player then we need to update

159
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,898
the position of the last sighting of the player

160
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:31,682
to the colliding game object's current position.

161
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,899
And that's this script finished, and the

162
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,343
end of our work on the laser grid.

163
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:40,176
So save your script and return to the Editor.

164
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,572
Then drag the FXLaserFence

165
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,572
on to the Prefabs folder to save it

166
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,075
as a prefab.

167
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,252
We can now duplicate the lasers and place

168
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,252
at other locations around the level.

169
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,304
Place the first duplicate just past the door

170
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,083
in the same corridor.

171
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,901
We also want to change it's name to show

172
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:02,567
that it's a different laser grid. 

173
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,064
Change the number to '002'.

174
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,069
So first we will duplicate,

175
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,766
then we'll change the name to 2

176
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,874
and we'll use the Transform tool to move

177
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:16,874
this up the corridor.

178
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,453
To get the exact position set the location to

179
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:25,165
(-8, 1.21, 9.23).

180
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,463
Now let's duplicate again. Rename the new

181
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:32,886
duplicate '003' then move this grid to the

182
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,651
doorway of the security room

183
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:36,651
facing the battle bus. We can do this

184
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,651
by positioning it at 

185
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:45,023
(-17.93, 1.21, 24.08).

186
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,807
Select it in the hierarchy and press F

187
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:50,501
with your cursor over the Scene view

188
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,143
to focus on it.

189
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:54,143
It should look like this.

190
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,143
Now let's duplicate again

191
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,971
and rename '004'.

192
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:07,765
Position this at (-23.92, 1.21, 26.1).

193
00:08:08,873 --> 00:08:10,873
Then remove the rotation in the Y axis

194
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,735
so that it reads 0.

195
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,735
Focus again in the Scene view.

196
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,898
Now reselect laser grid number 3

197
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,898
as it has the correct rotation

198
00:08:19,898 --> 00:08:21,898
for the other two laser grids.

199
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:27,183
Duplicate it and rename it '005'.

200
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:35,704
Now reposition this at (-8.95, 1.21, 25.99).

201
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,879
Finally duplicate to make number 6.

202
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:43,087
Rename it.

203
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:51,733
And set the position to (-8.95, 1.21, 29.96).

204
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,813
Then refocus on these in the Scene view.

205
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:00,482
You will notice that they don't reach

206
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:02,856
the edges of the corridor, so select

207
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,884
5 and 6 and set the scale

208
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,504
to (1, 1, 5.6).

209
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:11,421
The last thing we need to do with these two

210
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,421
larger laser grids is to set the

211
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:16,390
On and Off times of the LaserBlinking scripts.

212
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,390
With them both still selected set

213
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,139
their On times to 1.5.

214
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,139
Now select laser fence number 5

215
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,508
and set it's Off time to 1.5.

216
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:30,928
Now select number 6

217
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,935
and set the Off time to 1.55.

218
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,275
This means that they will flash asynchronously.

219
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,275
With that done what we need is a way to

220
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:43,275
turn off some of the lasers.

221
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:45,523
To do this we have switches.

222
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:48,338
We'll start by dragging the model in to the scene.

223
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,387
In the Models folder you will find a prop

224
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:53,872
called prop_switchUnit.

225
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:55,868
It should look like this.

226
00:09:55,868 --> 00:09:57,535
Move your Scene view so that you can see

227
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,383
the second room at the bottom of the map.

228
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,716
You will see that there's a poster on the wall

229
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,716
with the word 'terminal' written on it.

230
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,957
This is where we want to place the first switch.

231
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:11,305
Drag and drop the switch unit

232
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:14,204
somewhere like this. For the exact position

233
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:19,078
we'll place it at (-11.5, 0, 11.3).

234
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,237
Then we'll rotate it by 180 in the Y axis.

235
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:25,584
When all of the switches are placed in to the scene

236
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,584
we'll want to re-bake the light map

237
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,170
for higher quality.

238
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,170
So that these are included in the bake

239
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,894
make sure to switch the game object to

240
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:34,604
Static by checking the box at the top

241
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:37,312
of the inspector. Choose Yes to changing

242
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:39,312
the child objects of this.

243
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:42,074
We will need a couple of colliders.

244
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,074
First we will use a box collider so that

245
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:46,791
the player cannot run through the switch.

246
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,622
Click Add Component - Physics - Box Collider.

247
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,102
The box collider will naturally try and fit

248
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,102
the entire model, which in this case

249
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,102
includes the wiring on the floor.

250
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,102
We don't need it to do that so we will 

251
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,865
adjust the collider slightly.

252
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:11,439
Set the centre of the collider to (0.3, 0.8, -0.15).

253
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:18,310
Set the size of the collider to (1.3, 1.6, 0.81).

254
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,372
Now we need a sphere trigger collider.

255
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,372
This will be how we can tell the player is

256
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,191
close enough to use the switch.

257
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,191
Unity asks us if we mean to have

258
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,191
two colliders on one game object

259
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,485
and we do so we will choose to add

260
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,014
rather than replace.

261
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:38,356
Go to Add Component - Physics - Sphere Collider

262
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:39,758
and choose Add.

263
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:42,599
We will set the centre to (0, 1, 1).

264
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,629
We will set the radius to 1.5

265
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,888
and we'll check the Is Trigger checkbox.

266
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,056
We want the switch to make a noise when

267
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:54,194
the laser has been deactivated.

268
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:56,552
As such we will add an audio source component

269
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:58,014
to the switch.

270
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:02,233
Click Add Component - Audio - Audio Source.

271
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,051
We will uncheck Play On Awake so that the

272
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,051
sound does not happen when the game begins.

273
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,675
And from the Audio folder in the Project Panel

274
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:13,114
we will drag and drop the clip switch_deactivation

275
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:15,114
on to the audio clip property.

276
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,804
Now we need a script to deactivate the laser.

277
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,384
We will name this script LaserSwitchDeactivation.

278
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:26,605
Double click the icon to launch for editing.

279
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:29,243
Prepare the script for writing.

280
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,423
The first thing we're going to need in this script

281
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:36,423
is a reference to the Laser game object

282
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,423
we're going to turn off. We need this to be

283
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,242
public so that we can drag on the appropriate

284
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:41,991
laser once we're finished.

285
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,991
We also need a public material so that

286
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,991
we can change what the screen looks like

287
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,991
when the laser has been unlocked.

288
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,187
The only other class variable we will need

289
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,980
for this script is a reference for the player

290
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,812
game object, which can be private.

291
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:56,812
Next we need to setup the reference to the player

292
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,271
as we have done in the awake function before.

293
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,670
Next we need to check if the player is within

294
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,573
the trigger zone, so we will use the 

295
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,573
OnTriggerStay function as we did with

296
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,573
the cameras.

297
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,833
Given that the player is within the trigger zone

298
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,833
the next thing to check is whether the switch

299
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,833
button is being pressed.

300
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,392
At this point we want to deactivate the laser.

301
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:22,112
We will make a function in order to do this.

302
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,543
We will call it LaserDeactivation.

303
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,615
The first thing to do in this function is to

304
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,905
disable the Laser game object. We do this

305
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,905
using the SetActive function.

306
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,971
Next we need a reference to the renderer

307
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:37,737
component of the switch's screen.

308
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,513
The screen is a child game object of

309
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:41,818
of the switch so we can reference that

310
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,818
using transform.Find

311
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,818
Having found the child we can

312
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:47,818
access the renderer component.

313
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,818
With that reference we can set the material

314
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,818
to the unlocked material which we will

315
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:53,818
assign in the Inspector later.

316
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,423
We can also play the deactivating sound

317
00:13:57,423 --> 00:13:59,423
from the audio source.

318
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,923
Now we can add a call to this function

319
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,923
in our OnTriggerStay function.

320
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,970
With the script complete we can save and

321
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,970
return to the editor.

322
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:14,076
Now we need to assign our public references.

323
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,421
Let's start by dropping the unlocked material

324
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,406
on to the UnlockedMat public variable.

325
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,534
In the Materials folder in the Project panel

326
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:23,662
you will find something called

327
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:29,078
prop_switchUnit_screenUnlocked

328
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:34,108
Drag and drop this on to the UnlockedMat variable.

329
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:37,311
We are now ready to make a prefab of our laser switch.

330
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,770
We haven't yet applied the laser which we

331
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,770
will be deactivating with our switch

332
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,092
but since that will be different with each instance

333
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:45,092
we don't want to store it in the prefabs

334
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,775
so we will make it now.

335
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,775
Drag and drop prop_switchUnit on to

336
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:51,383
the Prefabs folder in the Project panel.

337
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,486
We're going to have four switches around the scene.

338
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:57,486
So let's name them using the same numbering

339
00:14:57,486 --> 00:14:59,954
convention we used for the laser grids.

340
00:14:59,954 --> 00:15:03,450
Add '001' to the name of the first switch.

341
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,287
Now we can duplicate the switch and place

342
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,803
it around the level.

343
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:11,803
The first duplicate will be on the far wall

344
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:14,890
of the lower right room. So duplicate,

345
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,597
rename '002',

346
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:23,500
place this at (-1.6, 0, 11.3).

347
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,702
It should look like this.

348
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:28,702
Now duplicate once more.

349
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:31,768
Rename it '003'

350
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:38,681
and place this one at (-17.7, 0, 33.3).

351
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:44,743
This should be on the far wall of the security room.

352
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,743
It should look like this.

353
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:50,265
The last one will go in the small alcove

354
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,265
on the upper left of the level.

355
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:56,743
So duplicate, rename '004'

356
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:02,887
and place it at position (-30, 0, 33.3).

357
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,470
It should look like this.

358
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:09,945
Now we are ready to assign laser to the

359
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,945
switches so that they switch off the

360
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,750
correct laser grids.

361
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,220
The first switch will deactivate laser number 1.

362
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
So select the first switch

363
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,485
and in the LaserSwitchDeactivation script

364
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:25,421
drag and drop laser fence 01

365
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:29,802
Next we can apply laser2 to switch2

366
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:34,352
laser3 to switch3 and laser4 to switch4 as shown.

367
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,477
Now all of our laser grids are setup

368
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:46,477
with appropriate switches and will function

369
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:48,477
correctly. You can check the sounds

370
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,687
on these by enabling the Audio Preview button

371
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:53,324
at the top of the Scene view.

372
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,675
Now we're nearly ready to do a high quality bake

373
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:05,211
of our light map, but before we do that

374
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,211
we're going to tidy up our scripts folder.

375
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,655
Select the Assets folder in the Project panel

376
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,282
and drag in the three scripts we've made

377
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,282
in this assignment.

378
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,887
Now you can see our Scripts folder is

379
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,887
beginning to get bloated and has a variety

380
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,651
of different scripts involved.

381
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,651
In the Scripts folder we'll make folders to

382
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,943
store these to keep them neatly.

383
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,375
First of all create a folder called AlarmSystems.

384
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:31,748
In to this folder we will place AlarmLight,

385
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:37,172
CCTVPlayerDetection, LaserBlinking,

386
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:42,022
LaserPlayerDetection and LaserSwitchDeactivation.

387
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:46,279
Leaving the last three scripts in the folder.

388
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:50,048
Now we will make another folder called GameController.

389
00:17:51,018 --> 00:17:54,233
In to this we will place the LastPlayerSighting script.

390
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:58,034
Now we will make a folder for our screen fader.

391
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:03,876
And finally we will make a folder for our unapplied scripts.

392
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,390
So remember that Tags is simply a library

393
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,390
of different constants that we can reference

394
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,310
in other scripts, it's not applied to a game object.

395
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,992
This is why we place it in a folder called Unapplied.

396
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,807
Now with our scripts tidied up we will

397
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,384
do a high quality bake of our light map.

398
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,384
Select the light mapping tab, or if you've

399
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:25,968
close it go to Window - Light Mapping.

400
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:30,278
Go to the Bake tab and set Quality from Low to High.

401
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:33,079
Also set the Padding to a value of 3.

402
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,410
Now we're ready to do our bake so simply click

403
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,173
Bake Scene at the bottom.

404
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:40,411
Becasue this is high quality this will take

405
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,669
a longer time than our low bake took earlier.

406
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:45,669
This high quality bake will give you a much

407
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,669
better looking environment and a 

408
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,669
much more accurate representation

409
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:51,100
of the lighting involved.

410
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,504
So when it's done have a look around the environment

411
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:55,504
and check out the changes that we've made.

412
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:58,700
So take this opportunity to have a break from the computer.

413
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,087
This is also the end of the first chapter.

414
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:03,087
In the next chapter we will focus on

415
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,284
creating the player.

416
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:06,784
Once the bake is complete remember to

417
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:09,820
save your scene and save your project from the File menu.

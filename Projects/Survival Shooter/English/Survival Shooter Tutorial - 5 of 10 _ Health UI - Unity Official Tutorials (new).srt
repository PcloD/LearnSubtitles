1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,930
The next thing we're going to jump in to is

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,368
the new UI system

3
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:05,368
and the first thing that we're going to do

4
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:08,533
is to click the 2D mode,

5
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,533
so in Unity 4.3 we introduced some

6
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,533
2D features and they're also useful

7
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,533
for the GUI.

8
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,533
So in the scene view there is a little

9
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,533
box here called 2D, so if you enable

10
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,533
that you will see that the scene view switches

11
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,143
to a completely flat representation

12
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:25,680
and that the gizmo in the upper right disappears.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,029
It looks like this.

14
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,651
What we're going to do is create a canvas.

15
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,651
So the way that the new UI system works

16
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:36,238
is that everything is based off of a canvas.

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,238
So if you go to Game Object

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,238
you can go to UI and

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,238
create a Canvas.

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,573
Game Object - UI - Canvas from the top menu.

21
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,741
And we will rename this object

22
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:53,738
from Canvas to HUD Canvas

23
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,738
HUD Canvas.

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,969
Just to give you a little bit of background information

25
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,969
the UI system is based around

26
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,159
the concept of a rect transform.

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,100
So rect, short for rectangle, has a number of ways of

28
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
displaying a rectangle on the screen

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,368
and every child object, every UI element is

30
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:15,359
based off of the parent object's rect transform.

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,359
So in the case of a canvas

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,639
you'll see that in a particular mode

33
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,879
such as Screen Space Overlay

34
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,683
the rect transform's values are being

35
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,683
driven by the game view.

36
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:28,683
So the first thing that I'm going to do is

37
00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:31,194
to select my HUD Canvas in the hierarchy

38
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:32,779
and I'm going to frame-select it

39
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:35,432
so if you hover over the scene view and press F

40
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:38,503
you will see an outline of this canvas.

41
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:40,740
so that's driven by the game view.

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,740
You can see if i drag the game view

43
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,086
the actual shape of that is changing.

44
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:49,038
That HUD Canvas is going to have all

45
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:51,038
of our child elements attached to it

46
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:53,038
and it's going to stay to the scale of the screen

47
00:01:53,038 --> 00:01:55,038
so if you're working for different resolutions it's

48
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:56,702
going to still stay full screen.

49
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,702
It's driven by this canvas component.

50
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,509
Canvas has 3 modes

51
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,505
Screen Space Overlay,

52
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:03,208
which is just filling the entire screen.

53
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,603
Screen Space Camera,

54
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:07,096
which can have UI perspective

55
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,096
and World Space, which is for things that

56
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,904
are intrinsically within the 3D scene.

57
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:13,904
So for example you might have a speech bubble

58
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:15,550
popping up from a 3D character.

59
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,550
We're going to stick with Screen Space Overlay

60
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,889
so we don't need to worry about that.

61
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,889
Pixel Perfect can be used to make

62
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,889
sure that all of your graphic elements are 

63
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:25,888
pixel perfect, but we don't need it for what we're doing here.

64
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:29,108
Graphic Raycaster we don't need to concern

65
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,335
ourselves with at all.

66
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,335
What we do want to do is to add

67
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,335
a component, before we do anything else,

68
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,335
which is a canvas group.

69
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:39,710
So what a canvas group does is allows UI elements

70
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,816
to have an alpha and it allows you to

71
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,816
toggle whether they are interactables.

72
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,622
So for our entire UI we don't actually

73
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,622
want interaction, so we don't want to put in

74
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:50,970
buttons or anything like that.

75
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,970
We're going to be putting in elements that would

76
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,490
be interactable but we can cancel them out

77
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,490
by on the canvas group removing that.

78
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:00,795
Also, because we use a raycast from screen space

79
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,574
to the quad in order to control the character

80
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,852
we don't want this canvas, which is going to be

81
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,573
effectively rendered in front of everything to

82
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,132
block that raycast.

83
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:11,657
On your canvas group, interactable, and block raycast

84
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,309
should be unchecked.

85
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:17,454
Real quick too, obviously the canvas is very big

86
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:21,192
and I just wanted to clarify it's so big because

87
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:24,948
it maps 1 pixel per unit, world unit

88
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:28,289
so that we get the highest level of fidelity in our graphics.

89
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,289
So if you have a graphic that is

90
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:33,614
512 pixels by 512 pixels

91
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:38,044
it's going to be drawn 512 units by 512 units.

92
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,905
And if you recall the capsule collider on our character

93
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,798
is 0.6 units wide

94
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:46,179
so 512 units is very very big.

95
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,615
So that's why you're seeing the canvas display

96
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,615
huge in here and then the level looking tiny

97
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:53,315
down in the corner, it's nothing to worry about whatsoever.

98
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,315
One trick that I don't want you guys to do

99
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,835
right now because it can lead to confusion

100
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,835
is that you can use layers to disable this

101
00:03:59,835 --> 00:04:01,835
so all new UI elements are automatically put on

102
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:03,835
the UI layer and what you can do is

103
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,835
just choose Nothing and then UI

104
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,671
to only show the UI.

105
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:10,114
But we don't want to do that, we're just going to work it

106
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:11,710
it out as it is like that.

107
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,710
Okay, so the first thing we want to do is get

108
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,710
a HUD element in to this so we're going

109
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,710
to create an empty child.

110
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,710
There's another way of doing this, so I want to

111
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,710
basically give you an example of each way

112
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,002
of doing certain things.

113
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,002
We can select HUD Canvas and

114
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,779
from the top go Game Object and Add things.

115
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,501
We can go to the Create menu here, which now has

116
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:33,223
Create Empty and Empty Child as of 4.6.

117
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:35,223
But we can also right click on a game object

118
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:38,191
we want to create an empty child for.

119
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,301
So I'm going to right click and go to Create Empty Child.

120
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:43,301
And I'm going to rename this game object

121
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,301
HealthUI

122
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,301
Capital H, capital UI.

123
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:50,282
Now the advantage of adding a child directly

124
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:52,282
to this rather than making it separately

125
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,282
and adding it is that because we selected

126
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:56,282
that HUD Canvas first Unity

127
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,689
knows that we're trying to add another UI element

128
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,689
so instead of the standard transform component

129
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,689
that it adds to any new game object

130
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,689
it's adding a rect transform.

131
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,689
And you can see that you have a slightly different

132
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,371
looking component than you're used to.

133
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,371
Just to draw your attention to something else

134
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:12,371
to do with UI.

135
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,386
This is our new empty game object, this square in the middle.

136
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,380
We also have up at the top a brand new

137
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
tool, the fifth one there,

138
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,380
which is our Rect tool.

139
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,380
And you can use that to scale

140
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,792
things, you can use it rotate,

141
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:29,418
and you'll also notice that when you drag these things around

142
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:31,418
we have snapping

143
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,418
and we have these mysterious looking

144
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,418
triangles in the centre.

145
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,418
Those are our anchor points and

146
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,418
they're a very powerful way to

147
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,660
position your different UI elements

148
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
and we're going to show off how you use

149
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,236
some of those throughout the day.

150
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:47,236
The first thing we want to do is to

151
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,236
setup our Health UI in the

152
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:50,986
lower left of the screen.

153
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,986
There's a button which may not immediately

154
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,710
appear to be a button, on the rect transform.

155
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,710
It's called the Anchor Presets button.

156
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,210
And what it does is give you all these

157
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,210
presets and a couple of different modes

158
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,498
using Alt and Shift

159
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,498
in order to be able to lay things out.

160
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,950
So the rect transform's position is based

161
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,950
off a number of different factors and when you're in

162
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,950
different modes and have your position

163
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,950
in different places the actual

164
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,950
properties that you're getting, the position, 

165
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,950
X, Y, X, the width and height,

166
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,950
will be different depending on how things are anchored

167
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,404
i.e. where those particular anchors are positioned.

168
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:27,840
So when they're all positioned together

169
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
so for example if I move this

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
and move my anchor to the top right

171
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,667
then my position is relative to

172
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,061
where those anchors are.

173
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,061
So as I drag my canvas in

174
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,822
you can see that that stays with the righthand edge.

175
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,554
So it's all based around this thing

176
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:45,036
but we're going to use some of the presets for this

177
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,036
to make it a little simpler.

178
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:49,651
What I want you to do is with the rect

179
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:51,316
transform button open,

180
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:53,047
hopefully you can see this menu,

181
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,645
we're going to, first off we're going to hold Alt

182
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,126
because Alt is also going to set the position

183
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,126
whilst moving the anchors for us

184
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,126
and we're also going to hold Shift.

185
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:04,126
And then we're going to click on the

186
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,808
lower left preset.

187
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,152
So you can see they've got titles here.

188
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,152
We've got Bottom and Left.

189
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:11,152
We're going to click there with Alt and Shift.

190
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,421
So you see if I hold Alt it moves the box.

191
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:15,421
If I hold Shift it highlights the blue

192
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:16,821
circle, which is our pivot.

193
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,023
And we click there.

194
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:21,023
If you have trouble remembering that it also says it

195
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,905
right at the top, Shift sets the pivot,

196
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:25,106
Alt sets the position.

197
00:07:25,106 --> 00:07:27,106
So then what you should see is that

198
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:29,106
in you scene view that

199
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:31,242
you have something in the lower left, 

200
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,903
it looks like this.

201
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,903
Then I'm going to go ahead and set the

202
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,903
width to 75

203
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:40,494
and I'm going to set the height to 60.

204
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:46,523
So the next thing I'm going to do is add those

205
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:49,549
child elements, this heart icon and the slider.

206
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,549
I'm going to again want to add something

207
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,549
directly as a child, so I'm going to right click

208
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:56,117
HealthUI this time, go to UI

209
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,992
and choose Image.

210
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,992
So UI Image is exactly what it sounds like.

211
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:01,992
It's any way to get a texture or sprite

212
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:03,992
as we call it in imported form

213
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,992
in to your UI layout.

214
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,050
 Once we've added this rename it

215
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,050
from Image to Heart.

216
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,598
Then in the rect transform

217
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:17,348
we are going to set the X

218
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,591
and Y positions, if they're not already, to 0,

219
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,591
and I'm going to set my width and height

220
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,591
to 30.

221
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,437
What you should see is a white

222
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:30,437
square in the lower left of your screens.

223
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,052
You should have your

224
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,052
HealthUI parent object and you should have your

225
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,565
Heart, which is a white square right now.

226
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:39,565
So when you add an image in the new system

227
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:41,565
until you give it a source image it has

228
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,389
a white background, so it falls back to using

229
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,946
it's colour property.

230
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:47,522
So that's just a really handy way to see

231
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,522
where the outline of the thing's going to be and if

232
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,743
you didn't want to see it at all you can always turn down

233
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:54,948
the alpha value, the opacity of the image.

234
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,948
But we do have an image for it, so we are going to,

235
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,813
on the image component,

236
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:02,510
use the circle select to look in to our Assets

237
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,280
and choose Heart.

238
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,156
Click the circle select to the right of Source Image

239
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,797
and choose Heart from the assets.

240
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,797
I'm sure you all are noticing

241
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:13,797
that the heart and the white box and everything are actually

242
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:15,797
appearing in the lower left hand corner

243
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,797
in your game view,

244
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:19,797
so it's very easy to set things up because

245
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:22,603
you can see what it will look like in the final project.

246
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,603
The next thing we're going to do is add in

247
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,363
a slider for our UI.

248
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:28,363
So we have the heart and next to it we want to have

249
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:31,215
the amount of health displayed to the user.

250
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:33,407
I'm going to reselect my HealthUI 

251
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,407
because I want to create a child of that.

252
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,098
I'm going to right click,

253
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,609
do the same again, UI

254
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:44,239
and this time we're going to choose Slider.

255
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,470
And we're going to rename this first of all

256
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,470
to HealthSlider.

257
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,731
F2 on PC, Return on Mac.

258
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,670
HealthSlider, capital H and S.

259
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,470
Then I'm going to set the X position

260
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,642
in the rect transform to 95

261
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:07,658
ensuring that Y and Z are 0.

262
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:12,004
So what this is effectively is a slider,

263
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:13,831
so you can use this for a number of different things,

264
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,366
if you have settings in a game,

265
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,780
you might want people to drag a slider and set something.

266
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,780
We're using it slightly differently, we're using it in

267
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,780
a non-interactable manner.

268
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,125
And basically we don't need to worry about the handle.

269
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,125
So what I want you guys to do

270
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,125
is to open up HealthSlider to see the

271
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,737
child object's that are standard within a slider.

272
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:36,600
You'll see that we have Fill Area and Handle Slide Area.

273
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:40,027
The Fill Area is in charge of the background

274
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,863
and the fill itself.

275
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:45,210
So the main space that you've got to fill

276
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,018
and what's going to be behind it.

277
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:50,299
We don't want the Handle Slide Area at all

278
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,299
so we're going to remove that from the hierarchy.

279
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:56,626
Leaving the Fill Area select Handle Slide Area

280
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:59,655
and to delete something, if you're on a PC, delete key,

281
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,655
on Mac Command-Backspace

282
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:03,655
will remove it from the hierarchy.

283
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:05,655
You should then lose the handle in the game view

284
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,655
and scene view and just be left with the actual

285
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:09,655
slider space itself.

286
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:12,982
So we want to setup what this actually does.

287
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,982
The first thing we're going to do is look at our

288
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,423
slider component.

289
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:18,423
So the slider component is basically all of the different

290
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:20,182
rules about what it's going to do.

291
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:23,131
It has an interactable checkbox, we know that we don't

292
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,131
want to actually have any interaction here

293
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,131
but because we've placed this under the canvas

294
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:29,131
which itself isn't interactable

295
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:32,645
we don't need to worry about the sub-assets

296
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:35,327
having interactable checkboxes.

297
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,327
We don't need to go through and check all of those,

298
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:39,327
the canvas being the parent is handling

299
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,497
all of that for us.

300
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,497
Because it is something that

301
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:45,699
you can interact with as standard we have a transition.

302
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,699
We don't want any of that either so we're going to

303
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,699
select Transition - None.

304
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:52,632
Then we want the Max value of this

305
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:56,395
to be equal to the Starting Health effectively,

306
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:59,229
so I'm going to set the max value to 100.

307
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:02,932
Then I'm going to change the value also to 100.

308
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,519
If you look at the game view when I adjusted

309
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
the slider you can see that that is

310
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
the value that we're getting.

311
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
So when I set that to 100 I know that

312
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
I can write some scripting that addresses this

313
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,519
slider and decreases that each time we

314
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
get hurt by an enemy.

315
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
Then what we're going to do is to have

316
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
some kind of visual feedback

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,086
when you do actually get hurt.

318
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,704
Because that slider in the lower left is kind of small

319
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,704
we want to have the screen flash

320
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,704
like it would in a real game

321
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,452
every time you get hurt.

322
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,322
So we can do that using a UI image as well,

323
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,322
So what we're going to do is to go back

324
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,245
to our HealthUI.

325
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,409
Reselect HealthUI.

326
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,622
Right click, this time I'm going to add

327
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:45,622
another UI image.

328
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,519
We're going to rename this DamageImage.

329
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,221
And because it's a brand new image

330
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,221
that's just kind of sat on the lower left right now

331
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,221
we want this to be over the entire screen

332
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:01,221
so the entire screen can kind of flash red

333
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,875
each time you get hurt.

334
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,875
So there's a very quick way with the anchor presets

335
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,932
yet again to stretch this over the entire screen.

336
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:10,431
So here's what I want you guys to do.

337
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:13,130
Is to select DamageImage, drag it up

338
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,130
and drop it on to HUDCanvas,

339
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,357
which will make it a child of HUDCanvas instead.

340
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,755
Then we can collapse HealthUI.

341
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:24,680
Once you have made it a child of HUDCanvas

342
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
you can then go ahead and select

343
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,721
and then Alt-click on the lower right anchor preset

344
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:32,375
as I'm showing you right now.

345
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,375
Alt-click there, and you should have then

346
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,899
white covering your entire canvas.

347
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,635
And then the final thing we need to do is

348
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:42,635
set the alpha to 0 for this.

349
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,635
So we're going to worry about the colour in our

350
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,635
scripting later so don't worry about that now.

351
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,635
But to set the alpha to 0 we just click

352
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:50,635
the colour block and then drag the

353
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:53,432
A for alpha down to 0.

354
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:57,624
Obviously if you have done that please do

355
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:00,160
save your scene, very important

1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,856
So far we have a game

2
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:05,318
where we can shoot a singular enemy

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:07,318
and you can be killed by

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,018
that very same enemy.

5
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,172
But currently

6
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:14,018
there is no way to score points.

7
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:16,018
So we want to add more to our UI

8
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,018
and we want to add the ability to

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,018
score points and represent that inside

10
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:21,649
our UI as well.

11
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,649
Okay, so, what I want you guys to do

12
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,740
is to take a look back at your hierarchy

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,612
and we are going to look at the HUD Canvas.

14
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:32,612
So the HUD Canvas is our

15
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:34,612
UI canvas, as you remember earlier we placed

16
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:38,169
in the Health UI which gives us the slider for our health

17
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,947
and the little heart icon

18
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:41,947
as well as the damage image.

19
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:45,394
But this time we are going to create a score text.

20
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,684
So what I'm going to do very quickly is just a the top

21
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,431
of the scene view click the 2D button

22
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,431
to switch back to 2D mode and I'm just

23
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:54,056
going to zoom right out

24
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:56,661
or what I can do is double click my HUD Canvas

25
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:59,674
to frame it and then zoom back in.

26
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:01,674
What I'm doing is selecting my

27
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:03,674
rect tool because whenever I work on

28
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:06,342
UI stuff I want that 5th tool,.

29
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:09,157
Show us the 2D button really quick while you're zoomed in.

30
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:11,157
There it is, 2D button.

31
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,032
Once we're in 2D mode we can then

32
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:17,032
go ahead and create some more UI

33
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:19,032
so this time we're going to make a

34
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:21,032
child object of the HUD Canvas.

35
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,301
Therefore I'm going to right click it

36
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:25,909
go to UI and Text.

37
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,813
So these UI things are basically a

38
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:30,813
collection of ready-made objects that

39
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,159
you can start working with.

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,840
All of the things that are in the UI system,

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,549
much like the rest of Unity,

42
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,549
are actually components, so what we're really doing

43
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,231
is creating a new game object

44
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,231
with a text component attached to it.

45
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,771
By default when you make a new text component

46
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,045
you made something that is default Arial text

47
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:49,045
and it is in grey so that it will

48
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:51,684
work neutrally on light or dark backgrounds.

49
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,684
So we're going to rename this

50
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,684
The first thing we're going to do is call Text

51
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:59,271
ScoreText, so capital S and T.

52
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:02,541
So rename Text to ScoreText.

53
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,334
Then what I'm going to do is to

54
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,900
re-anchor this to the top centre of the screen.

55
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
So if you remember we learnt about

56
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,028
rect transform's anchor presets.

57
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,451
And the way that we're going to do that is just

58
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:16,561
to set the anchor rather than all of it

59
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:19,726
to the top centre.

60
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,726
So it's this preset here.

61
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:24,624
We don't need to Alt, we don't need to Shift,

62
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,624
we just need to click that singularly.

63
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,624
And what that does is moves our anchors

64
00:02:28,624 --> 00:02:30,624
to the top, so you can see our

65
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:33,203
little flower pattern thing is now

66
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,255
sat at the top.

67
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,255
And from there we can then adjust

68
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,840
the positions as appropriate.

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
You'll now noticed that because I've moved those anchors

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,298
the Y position is -220, so the centre of the game view

71
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:48,796
is -220 pixels or units from the top.

72
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:54,272
So now I can say the Y position is going to be -55

73
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:57,012
and I'll make sure that my X is also on 0.

74
00:02:57,012 --> 00:03:00,577
That moves the text in relation to the anchor.

75
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:03,345
Yeah, so if I set that to 0

76
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:06,983
you can see that the pivot is 0.5, 0.5, in the centre.

77
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,983
But if I drag this down

78
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:13,286
you can see that I'm moving it a - value.

79
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:15,872
So I'll put that around -55.

80
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,561
The next thing we're going to do is setup the width,

81
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:21,801
I'll set that to 300.

82
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:24,835
And I'm going to set the heigh to 50.

83
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,939
And I'll set the color to white.

84
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,572
so in the text component you have all the controls

85
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:32,572
for how the text displays

86
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:34,572
and I'm going to drag in the color picker

87
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,838
so that my color for the text is white.

88
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,105
Then because we don't want it to just be Arial

89
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:45,016
and very small we're going to set the font.

90
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:47,544
And we're going to use the circle select and

91
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:49,544
choose LuckiestGuy, so that's a font

92
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:51,544
that we've included in this.

93
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,544
If you're not used to doing any kind of UI

94
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:56,875
work in Unity, because Unity is authoring another game

95
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,875
or application effectively

96
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,362
you need to include that font within your project.

97
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:06,772
So we have the truetype file for LuckiestGuy within that.

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,506
So we have the licence for it and we have the font itself.

99
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,506
That means that when we export it will have

100
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,506
the font and use it, it doesn't work like

101
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,506
word processors or Photoshop, it won't

102
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:19,506
just be able to pick from your library, you 

103
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,299
have to create a copy of the truetype within your project.

104
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,299
So our score text has that font

105
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:27,775
and we're going to set the font size to 50.

106
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,611
And we're going to use the alignment under paragraph

107
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,611
to centre and middle.

108
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,784
So centre and middle and font size to 50.

109
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:40,971
And you should see that we have new text written in there.

110
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:42,971
Obviously we don't want it to say new text,

111
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,971
we want to see what our actual score will look like.

112
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,971
So in the Text field I'm going to type

113
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:50,946
in Score: 0.

114
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,946
That's the default that it's going to look like

115
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,224
when we start the game.

116
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:56,224
Also important to note that we don't have to

117
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:59,457
set the text to say Score: 0.

118
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:01,457
Our script is actually going to

119
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,457
write what it is that text should be

120
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:05,457
however it's really hard to tell what

121
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,076
this is going to look like when we're playing our

122
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,961
game without putting some value in there.

123
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,961
So you might say later 'why did we set that text

124
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,547
when the script is already doing it?'.

125
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,547
The reason is so that we can visually see

126
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,871
'okay, that looks pretty good'

127
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,877
now let's go ahead and apply our scripts and do the rest.

128
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,877
So it's just a placeholder.

129
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:24,622
Now that we've done this I'm going to save my scene.

130
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:26,796
So File - Save.

131
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:28,796
And the next thing I'm going to do is put a

132
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,796
slight drop shadow, so there are some

133
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,796
effects that come with the UI system and

134
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:34,635
we can add them as a separate component.

135
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,635
We can keep the ScoreText selected,

136
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:39,922
go to Add Component and just type the word Shadow

137
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,922
and it will immediately find that component

138
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,922
and you can hit Return.

139
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,257
That will just give you a slight drop shadow.

140
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:48,257
I'm going to make it a bit more obvious

141
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:54,143
by changing the Effect Distance to 2, -2 in the X and Y axis.

142
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,659
It's also important to keep that

143
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,047
Use Graphic Alpha checked,

144
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,288
otherwise if you change the alpha

145
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:04,103
of the text the shadow won't also change.

146
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,885
What you'll notice about this is if I change the

147
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:08,885
alpha of the text itself the shadow

148
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,885
underneath is also fading out.

149
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,885
Whereas if it's not checked

150
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,825
we can fade this and then the shadow

151
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:17,732
will get left behind which is not desirable.

152
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,008
And then we need something to set

153
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:23,008
the score, something to be managing

154
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,037
the score, updating the text component's

155
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,522
text value with Score 10, Score 20,

156
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,522
whatever happens in the game. 

157
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,522
And the way that we're going to do this is

158
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,522
by adding a Manager script.

159
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:36,522
So what I'd like you to do is look in

160
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,205
the Scripts - Managers folder

161
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:42,691
and you will find out Score Manager.

162
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,691
We're going to drag and drop this on to the

163
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,062
ScoreText game object

164
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:51,322
Then once you've applied it you should see

165
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:53,844
it at the bottom of the list of components

166
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:55,851
right underneath the shadow

167
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,851
and we can double click to open that up.

168
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:01,998
So at the start we again have our public variables.

169
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:04,521
You'll notice there's a new keyword there

170
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,095
Static.

171
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:10,207
So a static variable doesn't belong to the instance

172
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:13,435
of the class it belongs to the class itself.

173
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,675
So let me explain.

174
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,032
Whenever we're dragging on EnemyHealth

175
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,885
or PlayerHealth or PlayerMovement on to an object

176
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,278
we're creating an instance of that class 

177
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,278
and applying it to the game object,

178
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,278
so they are all instances of a class.

179
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:29,358
And so all of the variables,

180
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,358
they're instance variables,

181
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:35,193
each enemy has it's own health,

182
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:38,218
each player has it's own speed, etcetera.

183
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:42,237
Static variables do not belong to an instance,

184
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,786
they belong to the class itself.

185
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,786
So what that means is,

186
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:49,769
in order to reference the score there

187
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:54,941
we don't need to go ScoreManager variable

188
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:59,751
GetComponent ScoreManager then use it, we just say

189
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,383
ScoreManager type . score.

190
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:06,314
So we don't need to create a variable to use it

191
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:09,496
we're just going to use it through the type itself.

192
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,886
So it only effectively exists in one place

193
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:14,886
we're not going to address a bunch of instances where

194
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:17,868
this exists, we're changing it in 1 place.

195
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,868
We could still have multiple

196
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,868
instance of ScoreManager,

197
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,868
we could drag multiple ones on to

198
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:27,704
a game object, on to different game objects, doesn't matter.

199
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:30,567
We're not going to, because that would break everything.

200
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:34,894
But if we did all of them would share the same score.

201
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:36,894
because it belongs to the type

202
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:38,894
not to the instance.

203
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,261
So the next thing is we need a reference to our Text component.

204
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,544
In awake we're going to setup that reference

205
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,127
to the text component.

206
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,127
Then we need to reset the score

207
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,127
because if we die we want

208
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,127
the game to reset, so,

209
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,127
we need to set the score back to 0.

210
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,127
And in our update function

211
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:59,122
what we're doing there, the text.text is

212
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,825
we're changing the text property

213
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,825
of the text component.

214
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,825
Okay, so the text component that we have

215
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:10,297
that string that we said Score: 0,

216
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,453
that was the Score text,

217
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,699
that was the text property of the component.

218
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,089
So what we're doing is we're setting that

219
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,089
to a completely new string, we're not changing that,

220
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,167
we're just setting it completely afresh.

221
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,025
We're changing it to Score: 

222
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,760
and then that number will be the score.

223
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,932
So very simply that's our ScoreManager and

224
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,932
if you happen to save it it'll ask you to convert

225
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,932
the line endings, it's no big deal.

226
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,934
Okay, we'll need to continue scoring points

227
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:42,934
and I'm going to select my

228
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,934
Zombunny in the hierarchy

229
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:48,808
and locate the EnemyHealth script.

230
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,484
And we're going to open the EnemyHealth script.

231
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:55,405
and have a look down at the very bottom

232
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:58,476
at the StartSinging function. 

233
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:01,299
James mentioned the public static

234
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,299
integer score earlier,

235
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:05,299
he promised you very kindly that you could

236
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:07,299
indeed say the name of

237
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,027
the class, ScoreManager.score,

238
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,027
so without saying GetComponent

239
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:16,373
or create an instance of the script, assign to this part of the script

240
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:20,383
we can very simply just say ScoreManager.score.

241
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:22,383
So we're going to re-enable that by deleting

242
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:24,951
the 2 // comments.

243
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:27,503
And what we're doing there is adding to it

244
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,622
the value of ScoreValue.

245
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:36,992
So scoreValue within this particular script is

246
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,691
a public variable that we can change.

247
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:44,728
This enemy has a value of 10 that when you kill it you get 10 points.

248
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,728
This way we can apply this

249
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,728
EnemyHealth script to different enemies

250
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,424
and have different score values.

251
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,424
So if you wanted to make the

252
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,424
killing the elephant worth a lot then you could

253
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,424
change that value, you don't need to go in to the

254
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:58,424
script and change it, it's a public value

255
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,424
so it appears in the inspector.

256
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:03,897
I just want to make a quick point about static variables.

257
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:07,705
So you know it's a lot easier to do it with static there,

258
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:10,041
we didn't have to create an instance variable,

259
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,041
we didn't have to assign it in awake

260
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,653
and then use it, we just used it just like that.

261
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,206
So why don't we use it for everything like that?

262
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,700
That would be so much easier?

263
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,147
It's because we have multiple enemies

264
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,147
and if we wanted multiple players then

265
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:25,660
we'd have more of those as well.

266
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
So if we wanted to change the health

267
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,848
of one player all of the player's health would change.

268
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:32,848
So we can't do it most of the time.

269
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,848
It's just very specific circumstances

270
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,848
where you'd only have one score

271
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:38,848
so we can make that static

272
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:40,848
to make it easier for ourselves.

273
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:42,848
So we're going to save this, it's going to ask you

274
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:45,865
to convert line endings, just choose Convert.

275
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,865
This project was made on PC and then

276
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,865
moved between PC and Mac so the files

277
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,865
get confused but it's no big deal.

278
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,554
So we should now go ahead and try it out.

279
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:56,554
So if you save your scene and press play

280
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:58,554
at the top of the interface.

281
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:05,050
There we go, 10 points for a Zombunny.

282
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:09,054
A very important point to make right now about prefabs

283
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:12,343
is that they are incredibly useful when you want to

284
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:14,343
spawn more than one object.

285
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,343
So some people might use if for rockets in a game

286
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,737
and you might use it for enemy spawning in a game.

287
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,737
You can use it for really anything you want to

288
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,621
But we want to use that for our enemies,

289
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,129
there's going to be 3 types of enemy,

290
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:28,920
and you guys have gone and created that first enemy.

291
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
What we don't want is just the enemy to be

292
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
sat next to the player when the game starts.

293
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,494
So what we need to do is to save him as a prefab.

294
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,494
So everybody make sure you've stopped play,

295
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:42,573
so play is no longer on, it should be black at the top.

296
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:44,101
No more blue buttons.

297
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,620
What we're going to do is to select our

298
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,998
Prefabs folder in the project

299
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,875
and then grab the Zombunny in the hierarchy

300
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,288
and drag and drop it in to the project panel

301
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,288
either in the empty space or drop it on

302
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,921
to the Prefabs folder.

303
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,936
Both of those will create the same effect,

304
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:01,936
you will get a Zombunny prefab,

305
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:03,936
which looks like this.

306
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,004
And you will have all of the same settings

307
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:09,004
that you had on the version that's in the scene.

308
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:12,106
So that version in the scene now belongs

309
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,106
to that prefab parent.

310
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:16,106
And even if we delete the version in

311
00:13:16,106 --> 00:13:18,314
the scene, in the hierarchy,

312
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:20,831
then the version in the project is saved,

313
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,191
and that's very crucial.

314
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:25,259
Everybody check that you've got your Zombunny

315
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,063
in the project, it's very important.

316
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:30,025
Then in the hierarchy we want to get rid of it,

317
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,818
so I'm going to select it there and

318
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:33,818
on Mac Command Backspace, 

319
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:35,818
on PC just the delete key.

320
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:37,818
Remove it from the scene.

321
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,812
And then save your scene.

322
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,812
Switch off 2D mode and double click the

323
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:44,812
player to zoom back in to the action

324
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:46,812

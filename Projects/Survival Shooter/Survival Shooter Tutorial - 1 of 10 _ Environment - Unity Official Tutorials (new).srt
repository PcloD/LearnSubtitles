1
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:08,347
This is a top-down isometric style shooter game

2
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:10,347
You are a boy who is

3
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:13,741
having a dream that all of his toys have come to life.

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,615
You run around, you shoot zombie teddies and other things,

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,550
score points and eventually meet your demise.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,525
So that's what we're going to make

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,326
and we're going to be learning about the editor

8
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:31,326
from putting together a scene

9
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:34,923
implementing animated characters, AI,

10
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:39,033
some of the new UI and lots of other stuff.

11
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,642
It's a very uplifting game,

12
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:42,642
you can't win, you can only eventually lose.

13
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,836
So that's the way we prefer to make them.

14
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:49,263
The very first thing you'll notice is that on my screen

15
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:52,084
I have the project open.

16
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,084
We don't want you to have the project open

17
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,084
at all, what we want you to do is to

18
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,084
make your own new scene and we're going to

19
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:59,780
put this project together.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,760
So if anyone has got the scene open

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,316
we don't want you to do that, we want you to make

22
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,260
a brand new scene.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,916
So first of all we're going to go to File  - New Scene.

24
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,916
Then what we want you guys to do, to make sure that

25
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,916
everyone's kind of on the same page we're going to ask

26
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,916
you to setup the editor in the same

27
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,499
style that we have. 

28
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:18,958
If you're comfortable with Unity, if you've used Unity before

29
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,958
and you prefer to work in your layout

30
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,220
of the editor that's totally cool, you can keep that.

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
But if you're new to Unity what we'd like you to do

32
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,631
is to choose the layout menu in the upper right

33
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,526
and choose 2 by 3.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,349
So layout drop down in the upper right and choose 2 by 3.

35
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:38,260
That would get you a style that gets you something like this.

36
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,290
Then what we'd like you to do is to drag the project panel

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,290
and drop it below the hierarchy.

38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,290
You'll note that when you drag the title tabs

39
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,290
of the panels around they will dock

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,736
in to different spaces.

41
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,736
Drop that below the hierarchy

42
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,874
and then you can just drag up the division between those two,

43
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,874
maybe drag this over a little

44
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,874
and then you should be all set.

45
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:59,874
So hopefully everyone's got a view like that?

46
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:01,874
Then what I usually like to do is

47
00:02:01,874 --> 00:02:03,874
with the project panel, because we don't really need

48
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,267
to use the thumbnails particularly

49
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:08,267
there's a slider at the bottom

50
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,858
which will change to list view when dragged

51
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:12,858
all the way over to the left.

52
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:15,664
So if we drag it over to the left you're going to see

53
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:17,664
exactly the same as what I have

54
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:19,262
on my screen here.

55
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:22,002
We are working with Unity 4.6

56
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:23,710
but right now what we'd like you to do is to go to

57
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,710
 File - Save Scene As

58
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,710
and we will ask you to put this in

59
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,710
to the Scenes folder.

60
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,710
We don't want you to use the completed

61
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,710
assets version of anything

62
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,710
just use the 

63
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,710
Scenes folder that's in the

64
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,156
root of the project.

65
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:42,335
And we're going to call this Level 01.

66
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:47,670
So save it as Level 01 in the Scenes folder.

67
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:51,684
When you've done that successfully you should see the name of

68
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:54,615
your scene up at the top of the interface.

69
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:56,615
Okay so the next thing we're going to do is

70
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,263
setup the environment, so I'm just going to show you that first.

71
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,629
So a prefab, just to reiterate

72
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,629
how this stuff works, a prefab is our way of

73
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:07,338
providing or saving a game object

74
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:08,330
in to the project.

75
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,330
You can do that for a number of different reasons

76
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,161
and we'll be saving prefabs in order to

77
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,161
spawn them in to the game later with the enemies.

78
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,161
But for the purpose of the environment

79
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:19,161
we prepared the model

80
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:22,002
and a number of collider and other elements.

81
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,002
If you look in the prefabs folder you will

82
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,002
find a prefab called environment.

83
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:29,542
Prefabs are represented by this blue cube icon.

84
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,542
All you need to do is to drag and drop that up

85
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,542
in to the hierarchy.

86
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,542
So just to remind you, the hierarchy and the scene

87
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:40,294
are intrinsically linked, anything that's in the scene

88
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:43,301
is therefore in the hierarchy and visa versa.

89
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:47,404
Just make sure that you've got a decent view of this level.

90
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:48,969
You can use the hand tool of course

91
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,619
up in the upper left

92
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,619
and use Control to zoom in and out

93
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:55,051
and Alt to rotate around.

94
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,051
We don't need to worry too much about the view

95
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:59,051
that you're looking at in the scene view

96
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:01,051
because we're going to setup the camera to look at

97
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:02,511
particular part of that later.

98
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:04,247
What we're just going to check is that we

99
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:07,160
positioned the environment at the origin.

100
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,547
So with the environment selected in the transform

101
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,547
component you should see the position is at

102
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,279
(0, 0, 0).

103
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:16,326
If it's not just fill that in, (0, 0, 0)

104
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:18,326
or go to the cog icon in the

105
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:21,479
upper right and choose Reset Position.

106
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:24,937
Then once we've done that we are also going to drag

107
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:27,630
in the Lights prefab.

108
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,346
Lights is in the prefabs folder,

109
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:32,346
you simply need to drag that in to

110
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:35,131
the scene and it should light your scene.

111
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:37,131
With the lights we don't need to worry about

112
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:40,262
positioning particularly because it's directional lights.

113
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:43,995
With directional lights you only need to worry about the rotation.

114
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:45,995
So if I just show you those briefly you can see that these

115
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,995
directional lights are pointing in

116
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,964
certain rotations and they're going to affect

117
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,586
anything in the scene, you don't need to worry about

118
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,101
where they're positioned.

119
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,823
The way this game is going to work is

120
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:58,823
we're going to have a camera that's

121
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:00,823
looking down on the scene.

122
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:02,823
And what we need to do in order to track

123
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:04,823
the player around and also to be able to

124
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,823
shoot is to use something called

125
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,823
a ray cast which is going to create an

126
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:11,904
invisible line from the camera to the floor.

127
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:13,904
But we've got a very inconsistent floor,

128
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,586
we've got a number of different environment objects

129
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:19,101
such as these stools, the Lego bricks,

130
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,101
the broken train

131
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,272
and all these different things, so we don't want to worry about

132
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:26,272
ray casting on to those at different heights

133
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,272
so to make things a lot simpler

134
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,272
what we're doing is we're going to add

135
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,631
in a plane quad.

136
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,631
So what I'd like you guys to do is to go to Game Object

137
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,576
3D Object and Quad.

138
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,340
What you'll notice is this creates a very small

139
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,719
1 by 1 quad right in the centre

140
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,249
of your game.

141
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:50,442
We're going to reset that to (0,0,0)

142
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
in the transform component

143
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,548
so make sure the position of your quad is at 0.

144
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:01,048
And we're going to rotate it by

145
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:03,747
90 degrees in the X axis.

146
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,048
Finally we want this to cover the entire

147
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,048
game level so we're going to

148
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:11,048
scale this by 100 in X

149
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,048
and 100 in Y.

150
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:15,784
We're going to name this Floor.

151
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,525
So rename from quad

152
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:21,987
to Floor.

153
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:24,362
So the next thing we're going to do is

154
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:26,763
to make this invisible, obviously you'll notice that it looks

155
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,132
pretty horrendous right now.

156
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,440
We don't want to actually see this.

157
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
What we want to do is use the collider,

158
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,759
so the outline of this shape.

159
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,380
We don't want to use this kind of grey for any reason at all.

160
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,380
So a quad is made visible by the

161
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,127
mesh renderer component,

162
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,127
and because we don't want that we're just going to

163
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:47,352
go ahead and remove it so with the floor selected

164
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,882
click the cog to the right of the mesh renderer

165
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:52,882
and choose Remove Component.

166
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,729
So with your floor selected go to

167
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,729
the cog icon in the upper right and choose 

168
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,729
Remove Component and you should see

169
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,688
that you can then only see the collider outline.

170
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,688
Make sure you remove the mesh renderer, 

171
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,202
not the mesh filter or the mesh collider.

172
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:11,077
Remember you've got Undo if anything goes horrendously wrong

173
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:14,071
but you should then see that you just have the collider around

174
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:16,071
the outline of the level, something like that.

175
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,918
Then because we don't want

176
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,918
our ray cast to check for anything

177
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,352
but this quad we're going to use layers.

178
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,673
so a layer is a way of isolating

179
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:30,114
things like ray casting or lighting for example,

180
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:32,114
to a particular group.

181
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:34,114
So with the floor selected

182
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:36,489
if you click the Layer drop down you should see

183
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:40,144
that we have a floor layer ready for you.

184
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,144
Choose from the Layer drop down at the top of the

185
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:44,144
the inspector, Floor.

186
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,311
And then save your scene.

187
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:50,311
The next thing we're going to do is finish off

188
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:54,015
our environment by adding some background music.

189
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,015
With sound sources in Unity we can attach

190
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,015
them to any object, it's a component that you

191
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,015
use to apply a clip to or you

192
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:03,009
use scripting to assign clips to.

193
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,009
We are going to have a separate game

194
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,009
object just to keep things separate and just to

195
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,559
keep them nicely organised.

196
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:11,820
So I'd like you to go to Game Object - Create Empty

197
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,614
and then rename this Background Music.

198
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,659
Return on the Mac or F2 on the PC

199
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,561
just like your operating system

200
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,561
and rename this Background Music

201
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:27,218
So we're creating an empty and renaming it Background Music.

202
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:30,834
Then we can add components to our game objects

203
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:32,834
to make them do different things.

204
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:35,501
So we have a component menu up at the top

205
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:37,501
with a bunch of different categories of things

206
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,887
that you can do to your game object to give it different

207
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,081
behaviour of different functionality.

208
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,362
What we're going to add is an audio source

209
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:46,652
so we can use this component menu

210
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,420
or we can use the Add Component menu

211
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
over on the right in the inspector.

212
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
So because the inspector will show you properties of the

213
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,150
game object currently selected we can

214
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,416
go in to here and we want to add an Audio

215
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,198
Audio Source

216
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,397
We don't really want to hear the music

217
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,397
for this game playing

218
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,834
every time you press play in your game

219
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,125
but just to make sure that everyone's worked

220
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,125
we are going to do it once.

221
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,777
So to assign a audio clip

222
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,742
to the audio source we can use the circle select.

223
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,742
We're going to refer to circle select a lot throughout

224
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:24,211
the day, it's the small nipple-like icon

225
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:27,660
to the right of the audio clip, and what that will do is pop up

226
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
a context window which is going to allow you to

227
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,660
find the file you need.

228
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
The file you need is Background Music,

229
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,177
surprisingly enough, and simply closing that window

230
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,177
will assign it to that.

231
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:43,297
For everyone's sanity uncheck Play On Awake.

232
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:45,615
We also want the music to loop when we are finished

233
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:48,035
with the game, we do want it to loop

234
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,044
so uncheck Play On Awake and check Loop.

235
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:54,998
In the volume in the component there is a slider.

236
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,288
And we can just drag that down to about 0.1.

237
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:00,288
So that's just to balance it with the other sound effects

238
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,288
we have in the game, and then you can go ahead and

239
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,288
save your scene once more.

240
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:07,360
That's the end of phase one, setting up the environment.

241
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,960
The next thing we're going to do is look at our player character.

1
00:00:00,472 --> 00:00:02,478
Okay, so as we said before, some of the

2
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:06,163
scripts in this project are pre-written.

3
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:08,163
So the main camera

4
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:10,163
is the camera that we're viewing our

5
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:12,163
game at, if I zoom our right now you can see

6
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:15,461
that the main camera is sitting behind the character.

7
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:17,461
And what we want to do is to set that up slightly

8
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,461
differently, currently by default when you

9
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,461
make a new camera in Unity you're making

10
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,461
a perspective 3D camera.

11
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,461
We want to make an isometric view

12
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,461
and because of that we're going to use

13
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,461
orthographic cameras.

14
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,461
So the first thing we're going to do is setup

15
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,461
where the camera is positioned.

16
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,461
We're going to select our main camera in the hierarchy

17
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:37,461
and in the transform

18
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:39,461
component we're going to set

19
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:45,877
the position to (1, 15, -22).

20
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,877
We're going to set the rotation to

21
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:51,485
(30,0,0)

22
00:00:52,735 --> 00:00:54,735
Then in the camera component we're going to set the

23
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,735
projection mode from perspective

24
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:59,849
using the drop down to orthographic.

25
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:05,555
And finally the size value that then appears to 4.5.

26
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:07,555
And when you look at your scene view, your game view

27
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:09,555
you should see that you have

28
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:11,555
an orthographic view.

29
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:16,406
Then a couple more camera settings.

30
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:18,406
We're going to set our background

31
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,406
to black, so when you move over

32
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,406
to the front of the level you will see

33
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:24,406
the background colour of the camera.

34
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,406
We don't want it to be blue so in our

35
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:28,406
camera component we're going to click on the colour

36
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,406
block next to the world Background.

37
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:35,167
That's going to open up a colour picker, which looks like this.

38
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:38,445
We're going to set this to black, so drag it all the way down

39
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:40,196
to the bottom of the colours.

40
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:42,196
Close that panel.

41
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,002
Then we're going to save our scene

42
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,002
just to make sure it's up to date.

43
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,634
And in the Scripts folder

44
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:53,977
we're going to select Camera.

45
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:57,217
So this time we are going to

46
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,775
create one more script.

47
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,775
This script is a lot shorter than our player

48
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,312
movement and is quite simple. 

49
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:05,299
So whenever you select a folder in your assets,

50
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,299
so for example we are selecting,

51
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,299
Camera in the Scripts folder right now,

52
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,077
we can go to the Create button and choose

53
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:14,077
C# Script.

54
00:02:14,077 --> 00:02:16,811
And it's going to create something called 'New Behaviour.

55
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,811
When you create a script, especially in C#

56
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:22,133
it's very important that you name it in accurately.

57
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,341
We're going to call this CameraFollow so don't

58
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:27,341
have any spaces

59
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,341
on your file names for scripts and

60
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,341
try to name them in this

61
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:36,160
capitalised style. Capitalised  style, capital F for Camera Follow.

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Quick note on creating 

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
scripts like this if you 

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
created it and then accidentally clicked off so it would

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
briefly new behaviour.

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Then the script, the class

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
that it makes will be called

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
new behaviour, so you'll need to

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,812
rename that when you open it.

70
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,812
So if I look at this one that I've correctly

71
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,812
named now, CameraFollow you can see it's

72
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,812
written the script for me, public class

73
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,812
CameraFollow, and what you'll see is

74
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,812
when you open it up in Unity and switch back

75
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:04,876
Unity will say 'class name does not match file name'.

76
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,876
So you need to make sure that everything in that class

77
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,876
is named the same as the actual file, 

78
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:10,299
your CameraFollow script.

79
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,299
So once you've named that click

80
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,272
Open to open it up in Mono Develop.

81
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:19,115
And you should see something like this.

82
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,259
What we're going to do is 

83
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:25,183
you get Start and Update

84
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:27,183
in your script, whenever you make a new script.

85
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:29,183
But we don't want those there

86
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:31,829
so we're going to select over that code,

87
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,829
making sure not to select

88
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,537
the final curly brackets.

89
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:38,422
We're going to hit backspace just to remove it

90
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,641
So we've got public class CameraFollow

91
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,641
and the open and closed curly braces.

92
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,641


93
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,641
Okay so as usual we're going to start

94
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,641
with the public variables at the top,

95
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:52,312
so those are the ones that can be accessed through the inspector,

96
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,197
or through other scripts.

97
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,197
To start off, we need to have

98
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,197
a target for this camera to follow

99
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,197
so we're going to make a public transform

100
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:01,811
called target.

101
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Next we're going to make a public float

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,620
called smoothing.

103
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:10,081
and we're gong to give that a default value of 5.

104
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,081
So basically our camera's going to follow

105
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:14,081
the player around, but we don't want

106
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,081
it to be super sharp.

107
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,081
We're going to give it a little bit of lag, a little bit

108
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,081
just to make it smoother for the player to see.

109
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,081
So that value there is going to be

110
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,552
how smooth it is. 

111
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,707
Lastly we're going to make a private variable

112
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,467
called offset.

113
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,130
We're going to store the offset of

114
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,130
the camera from the player, the distance between

115
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,130
them at the start of the script

116
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,130
and what we need to do is store that so

117
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,130
in each update we can make sure that we can

118
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,130
have the same offset.

119
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,515
So let's store that offset now in star.

120
00:04:45,717 --> 00:04:48,278
Offset is the vector from

121
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,278
the camera to the player,

122
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:53,421
so that's transform.position - target.position.

123
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:55,421
We're going to apply the script once

124
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,421
we finish writing it to the camera

125
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,421
so we need to make sure that the

126
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,421
transform position, the position of the camera

127
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:04,066
is subtracted from the target position, 

128
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,395
the position of the player.

129
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,378
So we're going to drag and drop.

130
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,378
Because target's a public variable we're going to

131
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,378
drag and drop the player game object on to

132
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,977
this transform target and you'll see that in a minute.

133
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:14,977
That's the end of our start function.

134
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:16,747
We just needed to create that offset

135
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:18,747
Now in fixed update,

136
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,747
so remember this is following

137
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,747
every physics step, and we're going to use fixed update

138
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:25,494
to move the camera because we're following

139
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:26,591
a physics object.

140
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,591
If we used update then it would

141
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,591
be moving in different time to the player

142
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:32,591
because the player is moving in fixed update.

143
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,473
So we're going to use fixed update to move the camera

144
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,473
and we need a target position

145
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:39,174
for this camera to try and reach.

146
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,174
TargetPosition is going to be the

147
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,620
position of the target + this offset.

148
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,620
So we're trying to find a place for this camera

149
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
to be up above the level

150
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
and that's the position of the player plus 

151
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,620
this offset that we've stored.

152
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,620
And now we need to actually move the camera

153
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,778
and we're going to do that using a lerp.

154
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,568
A lerp just smoothly moves

155
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,568
between two positions,

156
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,568
so you get that through vector3.lerp.

157
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,568
The position that we want to move it to

158
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:07,568
is between it's current position

159
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,568
so transform.position,

160
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,664
and this target position that we've just made.

161
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:15,097
So what that's going is it's saying

162
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,097
I've got my current position and the position

163
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:19,097
I want to be, I'm going to try and move

164
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,681
a little bit towards that.

165
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,681
That's what this function is doing.

166
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:25,971
We've got the two vectors that we need to

167
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,971
move between, now we need to tell it

168
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,652
how fast we're going to do that,

169
00:06:29,652 --> 00:06:31,652
and we're doing that using our smoothing variable

170
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,458
that we stored earlier.

171
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,458
And naturally since we don't want it to

172
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,458
do it 50 times a second

173
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,532
we're going to times by Time.DeltaTime.

174
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:43,772
And that's the end of the script.

175
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:44,933
Very simple.

176
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,933
So for those of you who are ready

177
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,595
what I want you to do is in the Unity editor

178
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,595
select CameraFollow and drag and drop

179
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,875
this on to Main Camera.

180
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,604
So from the project panel,

181
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,256
drop it on to Main Camera.

182
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:59,892
When you've done that and selected Main Camera

183
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,892
in the hierarchy, so you should see

184
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:05,533
this CameraFollow script that I have in the lower right.

185
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,706
You'll see that the public variables target

186
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,706
and smoothing appear

187
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:14,529
as things that we can assign to in the interface.

188
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,728
So target is looking for something called a transform

189
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,728
and smoothing is a number that we can

190
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:21,467
change to whatever we want.

191
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,467
Then what we're going to do is to assign the target,

192
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:24,994
the target is of course the player,

193
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,994
so we just drag and drop

194
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,014
player on to the target variable.

195
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:33,011
Grab the player from the hierarchy and not the scene view.

196
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:34,855
Clicking and dragging the player in the scene view is

197
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,855
just going to move the player.

198
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,634
One thing you'll notice as well is if you go

199
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,477
to click then drag

200
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,949
you lose the context of the main camera, so

201
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,949
select the main camera then

202
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,949
drag and drop player on there.

203
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,949
So basically all that's doing is it's finding

204
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,949
the game object reference and then it's finding the

205
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,421
exact thing that it wants, it wants to find the transform.

206
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,144
Then we're going to save

207
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,854
and then finally we're going to save our

208
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:05,017
player as a prefab.

209
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,017
So like I said before when we introduced the

210
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:09,017
environment the environment

211
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,017
was saved as a prefab because we've already assigned

212
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:13,017
a bunch of components to it so if you've got

213
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:15,017
something setup the way you want it and you want to

214
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:17,017
save it in to the project, so we might want to use

215
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,683
the player in other levels of the game

216
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,683
so we save it as a prefab and the way that you can

217
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:24,570
do that is just to drag it anywhere in to the project.

218
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,304
We happened to have a prefabs folder but you don't need to

219
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:31,481
drag it in to there but we'd like you to.

220
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:33,481
Player, drag and drop from the hierarchy

221
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,910
and drop it in to the Prefabs folder in the project.

222
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:39,323
If you turn it in to a prefab it's an asset,

223
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:42,932
a hard dry file you can save it, export it, reuse it

224
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,349
all over the place and then

225
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:48,460
yeah, so there's more benefits to turn things in to prefabs.

226
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
So I want you to save your scene right now and

227
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,135
press play and you should have

228
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,135
a little character that runs around

229
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,670
and you can move the camera, it should be tracking him.

230
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
And we'll show you what that looks like right now.

231
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,016
You should be seeing this.

232
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,016
Camera's now tracking around,

233
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:07,661
and we can rotate

234
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,099
like this.

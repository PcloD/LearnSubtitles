1
00:00:01,146 --> 00:00:03,660
Bouncing and sliding in 2D.

2
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:07,445
There are 4 items that work together

3
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:10,001
to make a bouncing ball in 2D.

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,478
The sprite image of the ball.

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:16,296
A collider component to give the image

6
00:00:16,296 --> 00:00:18,296
a physical presence in the scene.

7
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:21,957
A physics material 2D assigned to the collider

8
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:23,957
to define the friction and bounciness.

9
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:28,158
And a rigidbody 2D component to allow the ball

10
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:31,537
to be affected by physics forces, including gravity,

11
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,509
and to participate in physical events,

12
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,509
like collisions and triggers.

13
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,347
To make a slippery ice-covered platform

14
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,347
the rigidbody 2D is not necessary

15
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:43,347
unless the platform is moving.

16
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,049
To create a bouncing ball first add

17
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,049
the sprite image to the scene.

18
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:52,295
In this form this is simply what the ball

19
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:55,548
will look like and it will not interact with any other

20
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:57,548
game objects in the scene.

21
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,168
To give this sprite image a physical presence

22
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,568
in the scene add a collider 2D component

23
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:03,984
to the game object.

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,819
One way this can be done is to use the

25
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,351
Add Component button on the game object.

26
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,810
And select Physics 2D

27
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:16,415
 Circle Collider 2D.

28
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:22,939
The circle collider 2D is optimised for round objects.

29
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,750
For more information on colliders,

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,532
collider 2D and the circle collider 2D

31
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:30,163
please see the information linked below.

32
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,303
At this point the game object can participate

33
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:36,832
in physics events, but it cannot initiate them.

34
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,539
This game object will not react to physics

35
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,435
forces and is not influenced by gravity.

36
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:45,994
To do so we must add a rigidbody 2D

37
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:47,994
component to the game object.

38
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:50,812
This can be done by selecting

39
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,004
Add Component

40
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,218
Physics 2D

41
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,146
Rigidbody 2D.

42
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,887
Now the ball will fall under the influence of gravity.

43
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,705
But it is not very bouncy.

44
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,509
To make the ball bouncy use a 

45
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,509
physics material 2D.

46
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,649
The physics material 2D is an asset

47
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,050
and it will be stored in the project view.

48
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:21,562
One way to create a new physics material 2D

49
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,562
is to select Create

50
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:26,573
Physics 2D Material.

51
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:30,940
This will create a new asset in our project view.

52
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:34,654
The new physics material 2D asset

53
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,210
will need editing.

54
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,864
First it needs to be named.

55
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,806
Bouncy.

56
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:46,330
There are 2 properties to a physics material 2D.

57
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,348
Friction and Bounciness.

58
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,296
The bouncy ball should have a small amount of friction.

59
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:57,051
But more importantly a large amount of bounciness.

60
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,561
One way to add the physics material 2D

61
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:02,314
to the collider component

62
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:05,858
is to simply drag and drop the physics material 2D

63
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:09,731
on to the Materials slot on the collider 2D component.

64
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:13,445
Now the ball not only reacts to physics forces

65
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:15,237
and the other colliders in the scene,

66
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,010
but it does so in a very bouncy manner.

67
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,657
To make a slippery ice-covered platform

68
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:23,657
we need only 3 of these items

69
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,657
unless the platform is moving.

70
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,681
First add a sprite image to the scene.

71
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:33,260
Then add a collider 2D component.

72
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,846
In this case the box collider 2D.

73
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,223
And then create and add a new physics material 2D

74
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,223
to the collider 2D component.

75
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:54,106
It is possible to edit the physics material

76
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:55,689
2D at any time,

77
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,982
even after adding it to the collider.

78
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:01,753
The ice-covered platform needs to be slippery

79
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:04,128
which means little or no friction.

80
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,856
Ice is also very hard and not very bouncy

81
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:10,519
so it should have little or no bounciness.

82
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,722
With this new slippery surface we can

83
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,722
see that items slip right off.

84
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:29,305

85
00:04:29,305 --> 00:04:31,221
and physics material 2D,

00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,529
please see the information linked below.

87
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,925
If the platform were moving it would be best

88
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,800
to add a rigidbody 2D to the platform's game object.

89
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:48,609
And mark the rigidbody 2D as kinematic.

90
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,326

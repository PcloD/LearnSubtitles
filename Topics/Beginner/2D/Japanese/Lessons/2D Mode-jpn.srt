1
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:05,348
Unity supports 2D projects as well as 3D projects.

2
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:07,821
When working on a 2D game or application

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:10,531
workflow can be improved by marking the project

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,213
as a 2D project in the Editor settings,

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,283
and setting the scene view in the editor mode

6
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:16,765
to 2D mode.

7
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:19,327
When starting a new 2D project

8
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,854
these can be preset in the new project wizard

9
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:24,915
by selecting Setup Defaults For 2D.

10
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:29,461
If a project has been preset as 2D

11
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,711
when the new project opens it will have

12
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,920
it's editor settings and scene view configured

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
for a 2D project.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,114
This means that the scene view will be in 2D mode

15
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:42,501
and the default editor mode will be set to 2D.

16
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:45,222
It is important not to confuse the 2D

17
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,862
editor mode with the 2D scene view mode.

18
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:50,606
The editor mode describes how the editor

19
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:52,606
will treat the project.

20
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:55,282
The 2D scene view mode simply switches between the

21
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:57,833
2D and 3D views of the scene.

22
00:00:58,693 --> 00:01:01,961
Importantly these 2 settings are independent of each other.

23
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:05,096
The scene view mode is indicated in the editor

24
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:07,598
with the 2D mode button in the header bar.

25
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:10,328
With this button we can toggle the editor 

26
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,551
between 2D and 3D mode.

27
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,217
The editor mode can be changed at any time.

28
00:01:17,814 --> 00:01:20,960
o view or change the editor settings select Edit -

29
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:23,778
Project Settings - 

30
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,603
Editor.

31
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,711
The editor setting that related to a 2D

32
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,282
project is Default Behaviour mode.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,150
When Setup Defaults For 2D is selected

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,829
in the new project wizard the wizard sets default

35
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:40,829
behaviour mode to 2D.

36
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,514
When default behaviour mode is set to 2D,

37
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,266
and a new scene is created,

38
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:49,654
the default camera will be set as orthographic,

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,803
with an orthographic size of 5.

40
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,009
When a new image is imported, the default texture imported

41
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,009
will be set to the texture type of

42
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,009
sprite rather than texture.

43
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,701
For more information on textures,

44
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,701
the texture importer and cameras,

45
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,896
including the orthographic camera,

46
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,896
please see the information linked below.

47
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,039
When working on a project it is important to note

48
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,039
that the scene view mode will not effect the

49
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,039
game being built in the editor.

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,926
It is possible to make a 2D game with

51
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:22,926
2D optimised game objects

52
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,926
while the scene view is in 3D mode.x

53
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,730
It is possible to mix both 2D and

54
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,131
3D elements in the same game.

55
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:33,003
Having the scene view in 2D mode however

56
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,993
can help improve the workflow of a 2D project

57
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:37,993
and makes working with 2D optimised game

58
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,993
objects much easier.

59
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,617
When the scene view is in 2D mode

60
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,617
there will be some noticeable changed to the scene

61
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,617
view compared to 3D mode.

62
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,828
In 2D mode the scene view is locked in an orthographic

63
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:53,605
non-perspective view, looking along the Z axis

64
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:55,605
towards the X/Y plane.

65
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,812
The X axis is aligned horizontally

66
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,384
and the Y axis is aligned vertically

67
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,564
with positive values up and to the right

68
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:05,898
and negative values down and to the left.

69
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,603
In 2D mode there is no ability to

70
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:10,534
rotate the scene view camera

71
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:13,702
so in 2D mode the scene gizmo is hidden.S

72
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,301
To navigate the scene and position game objects

73
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,853
in the scene there are transform tools in the menu bar.

74
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,546
These tools are the Hand tool,

75
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:25,144
the Translate tool,

76
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:27,872
the Rotate tool and the Scale tool.

77
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:31,030
In 2D mode the primary tool will be

78
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,030
the Translate tool.

79
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,180
These tool buttons can be selected by clicking on them

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,180
or by using a shortcut key.

81
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,039
The shortcut keys for these buttons are the

82
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,412
Q, W, E and R keys.

83
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:46,836
An easy way to remember these shortcut keys

84
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:48,836
is that the transform tools are the buttons

85
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:51,070
in the upper left of the editor

86
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,349
and the shortcut keys are the keys in the

87
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,349
upper left of the keyboard, and they are

88
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,349
in the same order, left to right.

89
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,531
Q is the shortcut key for the hand tool.

90
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,389
W is the shortcut key for the translate tool.

91
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,442
E is the shortcut key for the rotate tool

92
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,919
and R is the shortcut key for the scale tool.

93
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,218
The hand tool moves the scene view.

94
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:17,218
Click and drag anywhere in the scene to move the view.

95
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,091
The hand tool can be modified by using

96
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:22,965
the control keys to zoom the scene view.

97
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,838
It's useful to note that the hand tool

98
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:27,838
can be used when any of the other transform

99
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,838
tools are active by holding down either the

100
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:31,838
Alt or Option key.

101
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:34,628
The zoom tool can also be used when any

102
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,628
of the other transform tools are active by

103
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,628
holding down both the control and either the

104
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,628
Alt or Option keys.

105
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,308
The right mouse button can also be used

106
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,308
to activate the hand tool

107
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:47,980
and the mouse wheel can be used to zoom.

108
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:51,451
The translate, rotate and scale tools

109
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,451
are used to select and position

110
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,368
game objects in the scene.

111
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:58,023
With any of the transform tools active

112
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:00,023
click on a game object to select it.

113
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:03,227
When selected a gizmo will appear

114
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,171
around the game object.

115
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,171
Each tool has it's own gizmo and the

116
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,903
gizmo will change when the tool is changed.

117
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,312
The translate tool is for moving game objects in the scene.

118
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:17,979
When a scene view mode is set for 2D

119
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,979
the translate tool can also be used to

120
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,979
scale and rotate sprites.

121
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,588
If the game object is a sprite and the scene view

122
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:28,530
is in 2D mode, the translate gizmo

123
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,530
is replaced by the sprite gizmo.

124
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,975
The sprite gizmo adds additional functionality

125
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,975
to the translate tool and improves

126
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,975
the 2D workflow.

127
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:40,322
When working with sprites in 2D mode

128
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,952
it is possible to work exclusively with the translate tool.

129
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,839
The sprite gizmo can be used to position the 

130
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,839
sprite in the scene by clicking and dragging

131
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,511
anywhere within the area of the sprite gizmo.

132
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,375
The sprite gizmo can also be used to 

133
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,375
rotate or scale the sprite.

134
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,814
To rotate a sprite using the translate tool

135
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:02,008
click and drag on a point outside of the

136
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,559
sprite gizmo near one corner.

137
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,463
This point is indicated by the

138
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,463
rotate icon appearing on the pointer.

139
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,001
To scale a sprite using the translate tool

140
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,599
click and drag on either the corner

141
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,599
or the edge of the sprite gizmo.

142
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,582
This is indicated by the pointer icon

143
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,140
changing to a double arrow icon

144
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
which will be oriented in the direction the

145
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
sprite will scale when dragged.

146
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,676
By default the sprite will scale proportionally.

147
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,690
To scale the sprite disproportionally

148
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,138
hold the Shift key while dragging on an edge

149
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,138
or corner of the sprite gizmo.

150
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,457
When rotating, holding the Shift key will step

151
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:46,437
the rotation in 15 degree increments.

152
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,891
The rotate and scale tools are used

153
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,942
to rotate and scale the selected game object,

154
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,834
and their behaviour is unchanged in 2D mode.

155
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,583
For more information on transform tools,

156
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,583
including the rotate and scale tools,

157
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,583
please see the information linked below.

158
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:05,898
The order in which sprites are rendered

159
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:07,898
depends upon details controlled by the

160
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:10,423
sprite renderer and it's sorting layers.

161
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,089
For more information on the sprite renderer

162

1
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:02,965
The distance joint 2D component

2
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:04,965
allows for 2 sprite objects

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:07,132
controlled by 2D rigidbody physics

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,659
to be attached together and kept at a certain distance apart.

5
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:13,671
The distance joint 2D applies a hard limit

6
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:15,671
rather than a gradual force to maintain

7
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,671
this desired distance.

8
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,386
The connected rigidbody is a reference

9
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:23,386
to the rigidbody 2D component

10
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:24,996
on the connected sprite.

11
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:28,558
If this is left empty, this sprite will be connected

12
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:31,356
to a point in world space in the scene.

13
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,606
To define the exact position of the pivot point

14
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:39,537
the properties of Anchor and Connected Anchor need to be set.

15
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:42,313
These two properties are needed to define

16
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:43,924
this single pivot point.

17
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:47,705
The first property, anchor, is the point the sprite

18
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:49,953
rotates around, relative to the sprite

19
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:51,577
in local space.

20
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,520
This point does not need to be within the bounds of the sprite.

21
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:58,813
The second property, connected anchor,

22
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,813
is the point in the scene our sprite is

23
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:02,813
maintaining a distance from.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,182
And this point is relative to the connected item.

25
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,875
When connected to the world in the scene

26
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,287
these values are in world space.

27
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,094
When connected to another 2D rigidbody

28
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:22,685
these values are in the connected body's local space.

29
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:34,188
When rotating around another sprite it is

30
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:37,372
important to note the collide connected checkbox.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
When collide connected unselected

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,243
the sprite will ignore collisions with a connected sprite.

33
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,349
To collide with the other sprite make sure that

34
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,349
collide connected is selected.

35
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:52,552
Distance is the distance between the 2 sprites

36
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,552
being maintained by the joint.

37
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,135
Max distance only will only enforce

38
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,135
a maximum distance.

39
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:18,044
If deselected the distance between the

40
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:20,044
objects will be fixed.

41
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,119
It is worth noting the gizmo in the scene view.

42
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,880
A line connects the 2 anchor points.

43
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:46,518
Perpendicular to this line is a marker

44
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:49,342
indicating the distance value in the scene.

45
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:52,273
This is the distance the joint will maintain

46
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,273
between the two sprite objects along this

47
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:56,273
line between the 2 anchors.

48
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:00,868
It is possible to have situations where the 2 sprites

49
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,868
are moved in a way that the joint

50
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:05,591
cannot maintain a fixed distance.

51
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:09,255
In these situations the 2D physics engine will

52
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,255
apply forces on the sprites until they

53
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,255
reach their fixed distance.

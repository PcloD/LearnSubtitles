1
00:00:01,257 --> 00:00:03,778
The hinge joint 2D is a 2D component

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:05,778
that allows a sprite to rotate around a point

3
00:00:05,778 --> 00:00:09,137
while being controlled by 2D rigidbody physics.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,830
The most obvious use of a hinge joint

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,830
is to rotate a sprite around a point

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,830
to make a door.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,465
But there are many other uses of the 2D hinge joint,

8
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:20,699
including machine parts, pendulums

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,699
and spring loaded trap doors.

10
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:25,558
A group of sprites with 2D hinge joints components

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,738
attached can work together to make a chain.

12
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:32,702
At the heart of the hinge joint 2D is the

13
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:35,265
point which the sprite will rotate around.

14
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,878
This is either a point in the scene

15
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,023
or another sprite with a 2D rigidbody attached.

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,765
This point is determined by the connected

17
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,937
rigidbody and the 2 anchor properties.

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,595
To connect the hinge joint 2D to the world

19
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:54,583
or a point in the scene, leave the connected rigidbody

20
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,583
property empty.

21
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:05,618
To connect the 2D hinge joint to another sprite

22
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,329
the other sprite must have a rigidbody 2D attached.

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,177
A reference to this rigidbody 2D needs to be made.

24
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:15,884
One way of doing this is to drag the

25
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:19,017
desired sprite with the rigidbody 2D attached

26
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:22,454
on to the connected rigidbody slot in the inspector.

27
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:25,812
To define the exact position of the pivot point

28
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,688
the properties of Anchor and

29
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,688
Connected Anchor need to be set.

30
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:32,285
These two properties are needed to

31
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,285
define a single pivot point.

32
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:37,681
The first property, Anchor, is the point the

33
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,681
sprite rotates around relative to the

34
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:41,681
sprite in local space.

35
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,611
This point does not need to be within the bounds of the sprite.

36
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,884
The second property, connected anchor,

37
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:51,710
is where in the scene this point is placed

38
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,230
and this point is relative to the connected item.

39
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,711
When connected to the world in the scene

40
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,918
these values are in world-space.

41
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:03,916
When connected to another 2D rigidbody

42
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,645
these values are in the connected body's local space.

43
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,215
When rotating around another sprite

44
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:17,708
it is important to note the Collide Connected checkbox.

45
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,208
With collide connected unselected

46
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,617
the sprite will ignore collisions with a connected sprite.

47
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,269
To collide with the other sprite make sure

48
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:29,094
the collide connect is selected.

49
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:38,725
The Use Motor and Use Limits are special

50
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,725
properties for the hinge joint.

51
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:44,366
The hinge joint can be actively powered by a motor.

52
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,115
When use motor is selected the hinge

53
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:50,674
joint 2D will apply torque and rotate the sprite.

54
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,643
Motor Speed is the target speed in degrees

55
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,992
per second the motor will try to reach.

56
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,392
Maximum Motor Force is the maximum torque

57
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,392
the motor can apply while attempting to reach

58
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:03,392
this target speed.

59
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:15,571
When Use Limits is selected the 2D hinge joint

60
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,663
will be prevented from making a full rotation.

61
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:21,535
Lower Angle is the lower end of the

62
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,535
rotation allowed by the limit.

63
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,035
Upper Angle is the upper end of the rotation

64
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,035
allowed by the limit.

65
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:31,336
Note the gizmo indicating the angle

66
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,336
limit of the joint in the scene view.

67
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,789
Motors and limits can be used together to

68
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,789
create new and interesting behaviour.

69
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:47,707
One use would be to make a spring-loaded trap door.

70
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,317
Use limits to prevent the trap door from

71
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,758
moving too far,

72
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,341
and use the motor to return the trap door

73
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,341
to it's starting position.

74
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:05,926
A series of hinge joints can be used

75
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:07,338
to make a chain.

76
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:10,087
In this example a kinematic platform

77
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,087
is the base sprite to which is attached

78
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,068
a series of sprites, each with rigidbody 2D

79
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,068
components to make the links.

80
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,649
Each link is connected to the link above

81
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,469
with a hinge joint 2D.

82
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,857
Note that collide connected is deselected.

83
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:28,417
At the bottom is the 16 tonne weight.

84
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,417
Unlike the links, the mass,

85
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,018
linear drag and angular drag have been increased

86
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:36,272
to give the weigh a proper feel in the scene.

87
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,287
It is worth noting that a distance joint 2D

88
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,287
with Max Distance Only enabled

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,025
has been added to the weight

90
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,025
to limit the maximum distance of the weight

91
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,592
from the base link, and to make the chain

92
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:08,592
perform more realistically.

93
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,857

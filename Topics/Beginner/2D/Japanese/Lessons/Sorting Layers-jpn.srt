00:00:01,257 --> 00:00:04,354
When making a 2D game detailed control over the

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:07,390
order in which items are rendered is a necessity.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,180
One way of doing this is by using the

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,612
distance of the sprite from the camera.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Unity however provides a much more

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,177
powerful tool to do this,

7
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,094
sorting layers.

8
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,360
Sorting layers work with the sprite renderer

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,906
to determine the rendering order of sprites

10
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:27,298
regardless of their distance from the camera.

11
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:30,454
A sprite, or group of sprites, can be

12
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:32,454
assigned to a sorting layer.

13
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,765
These sorting layers are given a sorting order.

14
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:38,764
The items in the sorting layer are rendered

15
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:40,917
regardless of distance to the camera

16
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,917
based on this sorting order.

17
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,541
It is worthwhile noting that the sprites

18
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,572
must still be within the camera's frustum to be rendered.

19
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:51,946
For even more control, individual sprites

20
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:54,320
can be assigned an Order In Layer value

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
to define the rendering order of sprites

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
within a sorting layer.

23
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,028
Sorting layers can be found in the

24
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,028
Tags and Layers Settings panel.

25
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,191
The tags and layers settings panel can be

26
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,191
accessed in 2 ways.

27
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:10,815
From the sprite renderer component select

28
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:14,516
Sorting Layer - Add Sorting Layer.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,347
From anywhere within the editor select

30
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:21,657
Edit - Project Settings - Tags And Layers.

31
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,875
With the tags and layers panel open

32
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,236
sorting layers can be added, deleted or rearranged.

33
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,984
There will always be a default layer 

34
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:32,984
present in the sorting layers list.

35
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,852
The default layer cannot be renamed or removed

36
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:38,852
but it can be rearranged.

37
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,675
To add a new sorting layer click the plus button.

38
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:45,368
To rename a sorting layer select

39
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:47,936
the Name field and enter a new name.

40
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:51,239
To rearrange the order of a sorting layer

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,827
click and drag the layer in to a new position.

42
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:56,637
The sorting layers will render in

43
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,500
list order from top to bottom

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
with the first item drawn at the back

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,656
and the last item drawn on top as the last layer.

46
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:06,598
To assign a sprite to a sorting layer

47
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:08,598
select the sprite to be assigned

48
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,598
and in the sprite renderer component

49
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,820
use the Sorting Layer drop-down list

50
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
to choose a sorting layer.

51
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,541
For detailed control over multiple

52
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,541
sprites on the same sorting layer the

53
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,986
Order In Layer value can be set.

54
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,801
If, for example, multiple sprites

55
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,926
are used to create a character

56
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:28,926
all the sprites used to create that character

57
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,409
could be assigned to one sorting layer.

58
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:34,091
And then within that sorting layer

59
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,091
Order In Layer can be used to determine

60
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:39,312
the draw order of the sprites, creating the character.

61
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,599
It is worth noting that sorting layers

62
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,890
and Order In Layer are global and available

63
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,890
to all renderers in Unity.

64
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,998
Every renderer, including particle renderers

65
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:52,344
can specify a sorting layer and use a

66
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:55,348
Order In Layer value, even though only the sprite

67
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:58,645
renderer exposes these properties in the inspector.

68
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:01,658
To use sorting layers and Order In Layer with

69
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,961
other renderers simply use a script

70
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:05,961
to assign these values.

71
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,585
It is possible to set the sorting layer

72
00:03:08,585 --> 00:03:12,761
by name or ID with renderer.sortingLayerName.

73
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:16,914
Or renderer.sortingLayerID.

74
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:20,310
To set the Order In Layer property use

75
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,658
renderer.sortingOrder.


76
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,136

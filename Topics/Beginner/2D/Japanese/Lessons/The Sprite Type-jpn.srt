1
00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:02,836
The Sprite Type.

2
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:06,359
When importing image assets as sprites

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,902
the texture type should be set to Sprite.

4
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:13,708
If the project has been set as a 2D project

5
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,652
the texture importer will use the 

6
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:17,889
Sprite Type by default on any new image

7
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,889
assets being imported.

8
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:23,134
For more information on setting up a project

9
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:26,727
as 2D please see the information linked below.

10
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:30,001
If any image asset has been imported

11
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,504
and the type has not been set to sprite

12
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:35,656
the sprite type can be set manually in the importer.

13
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,391
To select the sprite type in the importer

14
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:42,326
use the Texture Type pull-down and select Sprite.

15
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:47,714
Sprite Mode has 2 options

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,714
Single and Multiple.

17
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,549
Single should be chosen when the entire image asset

18
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,010
is 1 element and will be used as a single sprite.

19
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,904
Multiple should be chosen when the image

20
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:04,240
asset contains multiple elements in the same file,

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,031
such as an atlas of sprite elements

22
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,031
or an animated sprite sheet.

23
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:14,209
There is an optional Packing Tag.

24
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,501
This is the name of the optional sprite

25
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,156
atlas in to which this texture could be packed.

26
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:24,075
For more information on texture packing and the texture packer

27
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,635
please see the information linked below.

28
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,531
Pixels To Units defines the scale

29
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,531
of the imported sprite.

30
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:34,224
Pixels To Units defines the number of

31
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,473
pixels from the sprite that will correspond

32
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:38,871
to 1 unit in world space.

33
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:42,495
At the default scale of 100 pixels per unit

34
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,841
a 256 by 64 pixel image

35
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:48,407
will be applied to a game object that is

36
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:53,564
2.56 by 0.64 Unity units.

37
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,971
With Sprite Mode Single selected

38
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:00,551
Pivot sets the pivot point of the sprite.

39
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,134
The default is centre.

40
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:05,911
The drop-down menu allows this to be changed

41
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,496
to any of the corners or sides.

42
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:11,725
Custom reveals X and Y value fields

43
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:13,725
to set a custom pivot.

44
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:17,844
Custom pivots use values between 0 and 1.

45
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:22,192
Starting from the lower left, 0 is the start or minimum value,

46
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:26,512
and 1 is the end or maximum value on each axis.

47
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:31,828
(0.5, 0.5) is directly in the middle of the rectangle.

48
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,912
With Sprite Mode Multiple selected

49
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:38,773
the option to set the pivot point is

50
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,773
unavailable in the importer.

51
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:45,659
The pivot point is set per sprite in the sprite editor.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
The sprite editor button will open this

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,292
image asset in the sprite editor.

54
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,484
For more information on the sprite editor

55
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:55,915
please see the information linked below.

56
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,448
The Filter Mode and Per Platform Overrides

57
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,545
are unchanged by the texture type Sprite.

58
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,512
For more information on Filter Mode, or the Per Platform Overrides

59
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:10,486
please see the lessons on textures linked below.

60
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,490
It is worth noting that an atlas, or sprite sheet,

61
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,490
maybe larger than the default max

62
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,730
size of 1024 for an image texture.

63
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:22,948
If the image to be imported is larger

64
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,948
than the max size value

65
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:26,948
the asset will be resized to this

66
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:29,638
value during the import process.

67
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,868
To prevent the resizing of large images on import

68
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:36,034
the max size value may need to be adjusted.

69
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,158
 When an image asset is successfully imported as a sprite

70
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:43,817
the asset will update in the project window

71
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:45,817
and a new sprite, or group of sprites,

72
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:48,040
can be seen as a child, or children,

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
of the original image asset.

74
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,987
For more information on these sprite children

75
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:57,671
please see the information on the Sprite Editor linked below.

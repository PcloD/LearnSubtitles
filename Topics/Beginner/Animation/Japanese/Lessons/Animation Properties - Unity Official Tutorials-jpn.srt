1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,951
When you have a model highlighted

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:04,227
in the project panel you can define how

3
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:06,931
Unity interprets the mesh, animation,

4
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:09,709
and other properties using the Inspector.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,082
These properties come in 3 parts

6
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:15,955
Model, Rig and Animations.

7
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:18,455
In this lesson we'll be looking at the

8
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:20,455
Animations section.

9
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:23,024
The first option under Animations

10
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,760
is whether or not to import animations.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,193
This must be check to use any of the animations

12
00:00:29,193 --> 00:00:31,193
stored within the model file.

13
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:35,399
Bake Animations is used when an animation

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,316
has been created in a separate modelling

15
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:40,711
or animation program using inverse kinematics,

16
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,711
or IK for short.

17
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,853
And it has no yet been converted to forward kinematics

18
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:48,343
You can also choose what sort of

19
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,398
compression you'd like for your animations.

20
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:52,910
By default there is no compression

21
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,062
but you can choose Keyframe Reduction,

22
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,454
or Optimal.

23
00:00:57,438 --> 00:00:59,659
If you choose to compress the animations

24
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,369
you need to decide what error you wish to

25
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,344
allow for position, rotation and scale.

26
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,968
The smaller the values, the higher the

27
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,783
precision, the less compression you get.

28
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,305
Below the compression options

29
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,486
there's a list of clips that are available

30
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:17,122
from the model.

31
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:19,412
These can be added to or deleted

32
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,005
using the + and - icon.

33
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,390
Next to each of the names are the

34
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,804
start and end frames for the clip.

35
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:31,735
This is what makes each clip in the take different.

36
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:35,105
When one of these clips is selected

37
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:37,105
all of the options are available for that

38
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:39,105
specific animation clip.

39
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:43,797
The first option is the name of the clip.

40
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:46,642
Also, if the file has multiple takes

41
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:49,295
you will see what take that clip is from.

42
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:53,167
Next is the timeline of the animation.

43
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,621
Using the handles in the timeline

44
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,759
or the Start and End fields

45
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
you can edit on which frame

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,759
the clip begins and ends.

47
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,433
Below the start and end controls

48
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,831
is the loop controls.

49
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,823
Loop Time, when checked,

50
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:11,616
means that when the animation is finished

51
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:13,616
playing it will start again.

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,181
If Loop Pose is checked Unity will

53
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:19,979
try and match up the start and end pose

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,819
so that the looping clip looks smooth.

55
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,635
The Cycle Offset is for adjusting

56
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,635
when the clip starts and ends.

57
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,660
Use this for mirroring animations.

58
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,464
For example, if you want a run clip

59
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,051
to be mirrored then you might set the offset

60
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:41,022
to 0.5 so that the other foot is on the floor.

61
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:44,479
The Root Transform Rotation

62
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,854
affects how the rotation of an animation

63
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,854
affects the avatar.

64
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,146
If the root transform rotation is baked

65
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:54,852
in to the pose then the avatar will not

66
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:58,187
rotate with any turning in the animation.

67
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,432
Use this option for animations

68
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,597
such as running in a straight line

69
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:05,597
so that any slight deviation from a straight

70
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:07,597
line will not affect it.

71
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:11,190
The root transform rotation can either be

72
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,190
based on body orientation at the start

73
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,473
of the animation or the original source file

74
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:18,473
of the animation.

75
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:20,709
If Body Orientation is chosen

76
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,137
then the upper body will point forward.

77
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:27,021
You can use the offset to fine tune

78
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:29,021
the direction of the animation.

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
The next options refer to the root

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,295
transform position in the Y axis.

81
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:40,057
As with root transform rotation if you check

82
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:42,917
Bake Into Pose the avatar will not

83
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:45,750
move up or down during the animation.

84
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,295
There are a few options of what the 

85
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,295
position can be based on.

86
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,419
Original takes the Y position

87
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,186
from the source fail.

88
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,476
Otherwise it can be based on the avatar's

89
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:02,295
centre of mass or the position of it's feet.

90
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:05,528
Again the offset can be used to

91
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:08,265
fine tune the movement in the Y axis.

92
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,671
Root transform position XZ

93
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,811
works similarly to the Y axis option

94
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:17,631
except that it affects the horizontal

95
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,631
movement of the avatar.

96
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,735
Baking in to the pose will restrict movement

97
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,735
on the XZ plane.

98
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,691
This can be based on either the original file

99
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,691
or the centre of mass.

100
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:35,392
When you use the handles on the timeline

101
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:38,317
to adjust the animation you will see a graph

102
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:40,206
for each of the properties below it

103
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:42,206
representing how well it will match

104
00:04:42,206 --> 00:04:44,206
when the clip is looped.

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,318
Based on this matching each option

106
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,318
has a traffic light indicating how well

107
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:50,807
it matches.

108
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,807
Green for a good loop match,

109
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,545
yellow for an okay match

110
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,545
and red for a not good match.

111
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,295
Depending on what sort of animation clip

112
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:02,353
you are trimming you may or may not

113
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:04,353
want these to loop nicely.

114
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:07,480
For example, with a walking animation

115
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,034
you would want the pose to loop nicely

116
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,034
but you probably wouldn't want the transform

117
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,297
position XZ to loop.

118
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:17,957
If the Mirror box is checked

119
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:21,288
then the animation will be flipped left to right.

120
00:05:23,178 --> 00:05:25,855
For information on the avatar mask

121
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,522
and animation curves and events options

122
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:30,838
see the lessons linked below.

00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:02,894
Sometimes when animating an avatar

2
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:04,894
we want to isolate areas of the body

3
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:06,894
that are actually effected by the animation.

4
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:10,735
For example we might have a wave animation

5
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:13,191
but we want to be able to wave while running,

6
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:15,191
walking, jumping, etcetera.

7
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:17,773
In order to achieve this effect

8
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,773
we can use an avatar mask.

9
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:22,425
In this way we can restrict the effect

10
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:24,425
of this animation to be purely based

11
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,425
on the arm of the avatar.

12
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:30,475
Avatar masks can be created and used

13
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,907
in 2 distinct ways, but the overall effect

14
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,907
of the mask is the same.

15
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:38,153
Avatar masks can first be created on a

16
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:39,946
per-animation basis.

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,111
For this method go to the Animations tab

18
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,292
of the Model Importer by selecting a model

19
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:47,126
in the Project Panel and clicking on the 

20
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:49,126
Animations tab.

21
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,971
When you select an animations clip

22
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,529
there are a number of properties that appear

23
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,085
below the clip name.

24
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:57,937
One of these is a drop-down called Mask.

25
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,962
Here you can create a mask that is unique

26
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:03,625
to the specific animation you are editing.

27
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:06,954
The other method for creating an avatar mask

28
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:09,771
is to create it as an asset in your Project Panel

29
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:14,009
by right-clicking and selecting Create - Avatar Mask.

30
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:17,742
Once it is created it can then be applied

31
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,742
to the layers of an animator controller

32
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:21,505
using the Animator window.

33
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,686
Creating and applying a mask this way will

34
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:27,994
effect all animations on an animator layer.

35
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:31,600
For more information on animator layers

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
see the lesson linked below.

37
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:37,386
An avatar mask has 2 parts,

38
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:39,386
Humanoid and Transform.

39
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:42,646
The Humanoid drop-down has a diagram

40
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:45,381
of a humanoid facing you from the screen.

41
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:48,299
This means that the diagram's left hand

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,299
is on the right side.

43
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,423
By clicking on each section you can toggle

44
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:55,423
it's colour between red and green.

45
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,200
You can also click outside the diagram

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,960
to toggle between all red and all green.

47
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,219
The colour indicates which parts of a humanoid

48
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,143
avatar will be animated when using this mask.

49
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:10,640
Green indicates that the body part will be used

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,068
and red indicates that it will not be used.

51
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:16,548
For our wave animation we have all but the

52
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:18,548
right arm deselected.

53
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:20,178
This means that only the right arm

54
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:22,178
will be effected by the animation.

55
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:27,013
The second part is the Transform Mask.

56
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,623
Transform masks are used for generically

57
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:32,150
rigged models and humanoid rigged models

58
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,150
with extra bones.

59
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,290
For example, if you had a 4 legged robot

60
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,290
or a humanoid with wings.

61
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:42,177
Here you need to select the avatar

62
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:43,899
to base the mask on.

63
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,505
This is done using the circle select button.

64
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,242
When an avatar has been selected

65
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:55,224
and imported a full list of all of the transforms

66
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:57,224
for that avatar appear.

67
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,034
From this you can select or deselect

68
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,673
which transforms should be effected

69
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:03,477
by the animation.

70
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,477
If a transform is checked then it will be

71
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,594
part of the mask and will move when animated.

72
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:11,204
For example, imagine we have a 

73
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:13,204
humanoid avatar with a tail.

74
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,144
In the base layer of the animator state machine

75
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,655
the character has it's locomotion managed.

76
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,849
On subsequent layers other animations

77
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,849
such as attacking are handled.

78
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,625
It might be a good idea for these subsequent

79
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,751
layers to have a transform mask where

80
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,751
the tail bones are unchecked.

81
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:33,914
This means that the tail is not effected

82
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,914
by animations on those layers

83
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:38,496
and will still be moved by animations playing

84
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,496
on the base layer.

1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:02,445
The animation view allows you to create and

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:06,040
modify animation clips directly inside Unity.

3
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:08,595
It is designed to act as a powerful

4
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:10,595
and straightforward alternative to external

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,595
3D animation programmes.

6
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,772
For instance, if we wanted to have

7
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,772
a camera fly around a scene to give

8
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:20,186
a player an overview of a level

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,313
we can create that animation for it in Unity.

10
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:26,794
Here we have a scene with a camera

11
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,040
in the corner.

12
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:31,018
We would like to create an animation

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:33,512
for that camera which will allow it to move

14
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:36,129
from one side of the scene to the other.

15
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:38,965
Since we want to make an animation for the

16
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:40,965
camera we will want to ensure

17
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,986
that it is selected in the Hierarchy view.

18
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,955
We can then open the Animation view

19
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:49,356
by clicking Window - Animation.

20
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:53,015
Like any other view this is moveable

21
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,015
resizable and dockable.

22
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,805
There are many different buttons and options

23
00:00:57,805 --> 00:01:00,723
visible when you first open the Animation view.

24
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:04,862
First and foremost is the animation drop-down.

25
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:06,572
Here is where we can select our different

26
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,252
animations to edit.

27
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:11,404
Since we don't currently have any animations

28
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,404
this drop-down is blank except for the

29
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:15,974
ability to create a new animation.

30
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,907
When you create a new animation you will

31
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,447
be prompted for a name and a location

32
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,447
to save the animation file.

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,140
We will create an animation called 

34
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,140
CameraFlyThu and place it

35
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,140
in the Animations folder.

36
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:34,426
The Add Curve button allows us to choose

37
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,148
which components of our object,

38
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:38,148
or any child objects, we wish to modify

39
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:40,148
with our animation.

40
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,020
Each component can be expanded

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,020
to view more options.

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,982
To add a curve click the + sign next

43
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,692
to the item you wish to add.

44
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,748
Since we want our camera to fly around the scene

45
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:56,847
we will add the transform's position and rotation.

46
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,969
The timeline is where you will be able to

47
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,786
establish the timing of your animation.

48
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:05,408
The timeline is measured in frames and seconds.

49
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,152
The red scrubber allows you to choose what

50
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,152
frame you wish to modify.

51
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:14,700
Next is the Record and Play buttons.

52
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:16,920
When the record button is pressed

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,529
changes made to the chosen object

54
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:21,336
in the Scene view will be added automatically

55
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:24,345
to the animation at the currently selected frame.

56
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,949
The play button will allow you to preview

57
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,249
your animation.

58
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,409
The left and right arrows allow you to

59
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,930
navigate through the keyframes of the animation.

60
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,847
Next are the buttons which allow you to

61
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:39,847
add keyframes and events to the

62
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:41,847
currently selected frame.

63
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,430
The Sample property determines how many

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,747
frames make up one second of animation.

65
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,618
Reducing this number makes our animations slower.

66
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:54,057
At the bottom are two buttons that allow

67
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,777
you to transition between dope sheet mode,

68
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,447
which we are currently on,

69
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,447
and curve view mode.

70
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,541
With the record button pressed

71
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,803
it can be very easy to rough out the animation

72
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:07,081
that we want.

73
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:10,306
Simply select the frame we want to modify

74
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:14,802
and rotation in the scene view.

75
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,306
and then set the desired camera position

76
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,540
You will notice that a keyframe has been added

77
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,149
to the timeline with the appropriate values.

78
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,883
Properties that are currently being animated

79
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:25,588
are highlighted in red in the Inspector.

80
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:29,941
We can continue doing this for the various phases

81
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,941
of our fly through animation.

82
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,463
To preview the animation click the

83
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:38,116
play icon next to the record icon

84
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:40,116
in the animator view.

85
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:44,381
If we were satisfied with our animation

86
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:46,381
we could be done now.

87
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:49,297
If we wanted to fine tune our animation however

88
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,717
we would want to look at the curves mode.

89
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,364
To enter the curves mode select the Curves button

90
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:58,082
at the bottom of the animation view.

91
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,010
Here we can see the various curves of our

92
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,497
animation by selecting the corresponding

93
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,677
component on the left.

94
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:08,771
Again we can select a frame using the red

95
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,771
red scrubber on the timeline.

96
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,605
To modify a value on a curve

97
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,605
click and drag a keyframe to the new

98
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,479
desired value.

99
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,852
To create a new keyframe click the

100
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:23,742
Create Keyframe button,

101
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,742
or double click on the curve.

102
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:28,779
Right-clicking on a keyframe will pull up

103
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,695
some of it's options.

104
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:32,695
the most notable of these options is the ability

105
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:34,695
to choose Free Smooth.

106
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:37,830
This will create two handles are the keyframe

107
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,830
which you can use to smooth the curve

108
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,830
to your liking.

109
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,786
Another way to control our curves is to

110
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,786
choose the Broken option.

111
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,687
This allows you to control each side of the

112
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,687
keyframe indecently.

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,400
In this example we will want to add

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,986
a little variance to the exposition

115
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:58,791
of the transform.

116
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,205
Doing so will give us more of a weightless feel

117
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,205
to our animation.

118
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:07,323
Again we can do so by creating keyframes

119
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,323
on the exposition curve and changing

120
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,323
our values manually.

121
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,192
The animations created in Unity have the same

122
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,555
Inspector settings as animations made

123
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:20,237
in external programmes.

124
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,403
We can see these by selecting our clip

125
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:24,636
in the Project view.

126
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:26,319
Since we want our camera to fly across the

127
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,278
screen only once, we best uncheck

128
00:05:29,278 --> 00:05:31,278
are Loop Time property.

129
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,828
It is interesting to note that an animator

130
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,828
is in charge of animation playback for generic

131
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:39,463
objects the same as it is for humanoids.

132
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:42,184
Unity has automatically added the

133
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:44,543
animator to our camera and created an

134
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:47,113
animator controller, a state machine

135
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,113
and added it to this component

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,477
The clip we just created is added to the

137
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,477
state machine as the default clip

138
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:56,477
that would be played at runtime.

139
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,695
This means we can go on to record

140
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,695
other clips and use the animator

141
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,695
to decide when to play them.

142
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,473
In this manner, once our animation clip

143
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:08,952
is completed we can run our scene

144
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,952
to see it in action.

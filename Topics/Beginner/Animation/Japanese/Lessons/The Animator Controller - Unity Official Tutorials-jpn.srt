1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:02,472
Animator Controllers contain one or more

2
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:04,472
state machines that determine which animations

3
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,472
are currently being played.

4
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:09,806
These states are controlled by parameters

5
00:00:09,806 --> 00:00:12,568
which get their values from scripts.

6
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:15,879
To create an animator controller

7
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:18,569
click the Create menu in the Project view

8
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:21,439
and select Animator Controller.

9
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,743
You can also just right click any blank

10
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,895
space in the Asset view and select

11
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,268
Create - Animator Controller.

12
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,585
Animator Controllers are managed

13
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:34,585
through the Animator window.

14
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:37,209
To open the Animator window either click

15
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,209
Window - Animator

16
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:43,709
or double click on any animator controller asset.

17
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,132
This window is resizable and dockable

18
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:48,966
allowing you to place it wherever makes the

19
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,966
most sense for your workflow.

20
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,267
Parameters are created by clicking the

21
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:57,126
plus icon next to the word Parameters

22
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:00,807
in the bottom lefthand corner of the Animator Window.

23
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:04,066
They can be either floats, ints,

24
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,066
Booleans or triggers.

25
00:01:06,787 --> 00:01:08,933
Parameters generally represent qualities of

26
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,882
an animation or decision making condition.

27
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,492
For example, if you are animating a

28
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,687
humanoid's movement a common approach

29
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:20,442
could be to create a float parameter for Speed.

30
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,305
When the Speed parameter is large

31
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:25,208
the animator controller can be made to

32
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,182
transition the states with faster animations.

33
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:32,000
States can be made in one of three ways.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,207
The first way is to drag an animation clip

35
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:37,124
from your project panel on to some

36
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,608
empty space in the Animator panel.

37
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,596
This will create a state who's motion

38
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,568
is that of the animation clip

39
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,129
that was dragged on.

40
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,064
The second way is to right-click on some

41
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,467
empty space in the Animator panel

42
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,785
and select Create State.

43
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,909
From here you are given three options.

44
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:00,828
Empty, From Selected Clip and

45
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,828
From New Blend Tree.

46
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,576
For information on Blend Trees

47
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,800
see the lesson linked below.

48
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,278
An empty state is simply one that does

49
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,054
not have any motion.

50
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:15,233
These can be useful as they do not mask

51
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:18,098
animation that is being played on other layers.

52
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,538
For information on Animator Layers

53
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,538
see the lesson linked below.

54
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,558
To create a state from a selected clip

55
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:29,280
you must have the animation

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
you wish to make in to a state

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
highlighted in the project panel.

58
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:38,700
The third way to create an animator state

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,421
is to create an animation

60
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:41,990
in the animation window.

61
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,992
This is separate and distinct

62
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:46,509
from the animator window.

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,912
When you create the animation

64
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,773
It will create a state for it

65
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:53,867
in the base layer of the animator controller

66
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,729
that the animation is being created for.

67
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,568
The Animation Window is covered in it's

68
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,568
own video linked below.

69
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,679
The first state created on any layer

70
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,679
will become the default state

71
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,751
which is shown by the state's colour being orange.

72
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,680
You can change which state is default

73
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,391
by right-clicking on the state you wish

74
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:18,011
to be default and selecting Set As Default.

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,343
The default state is the one who's animation

76
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,343
will be played to start with.

77
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,078
To edit states in the Inspector panel

78
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,718
simply click on them.

79
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,146
At the top we can specify a name

80
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,843
and a tag for the state.

81
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,425
Both can be referenced through a code

82
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,094
if you want to perform any actions

83
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,094
while in specific states.

84
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,401
So it is a good idea to set those

85
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:43,401
to something meaningful.

86
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:46,384
The Speed property refers to how fast

87
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,245
the animation plays compared to it's 

88
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,953
normal playback speed.

89
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:53,270
A value of 1 indicates normal speed.

90
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,031
The Motion property is the particular

91
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:59,581
animation clip for the state.

92
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,382
Foot IK stands for

93
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,896
Foot Inverse Kinematics.

94
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,226
If this option is checked

95
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:10,519
it will reduce or eliminate

96
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,253
any foot slipping in your animation.

97
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:16,676
The Mirror property simply flips the

98
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:19,035
animation left to right.

99
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,226
Below this is a list of transitions

100
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:25,226
from this state to others.

101
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:27,892
Currently there aren't any,

102
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,892
so let's look at creating some.

103
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:33,704
A transition allows our animator controller

104
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:36,145
to smoothly move from one animation clip

105
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,164
to another.

106
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:40,973
We can specify when and how to transition

107
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:43,627
which gives us a high level of control.

108
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,338
To create a transition between states

109
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:48,980
right-click on a state that you wish to 

110
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,889
transition from and select Make Transition.

111
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:56,035
You will then have a transition arrow

112
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,035
attached to your cursor.

113
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,999
Click on another state to complete the transition.

114
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,230
You can click on the transition

115
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,230
to edit it in the Inspector.

116
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,572
Each transition has the options

117
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:12,320
Solo and Mute.

118
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:15,545
Mute effectively disables the transition

119
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:18,477
Solo takes in to account all the transitions

120
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:20,643
that come from the same state

121
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,989
and effectively mutes all those

122
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,989
that aren't marked as solo.

123
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:28,568
Mute and solo are tools for debugging

124
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:31,453
and focusing on particular areas of state machines.

125
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:33,508
They should not be checked

126
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:35,508
on any published builds.

127
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,809
Beneath those properties you have the option

128
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,809
of naming the transition.

129
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,570
Under that you have the Atomic Property.

130
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,483
If the atomic property is checked

131
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,483
it means that the transition is

132
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,553
not interruptible by other transitions.

133
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,283
The graph shows how the animation

134
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,283
is handled during the transition.

135
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,004
The scale is in seconds and frames.

136
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:02,504
There are three markers on the scale.

137
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,047
They represent the start and end of the

138
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,785
transition in time and the scrubber

139
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:09,334
for previewing the animation of the transition.

140
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,652
Between the start and end marker

141
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,901
is a blue shaded region which represents

142
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,901
the transition from one animation to the next.

143
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,908
The graph curves represent which foot

144
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:22,908
is the most stable over time.

145
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:26,059
For a state with a running animation

146
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,920
we'll see a curve changing from up to

147
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,547
down and back.

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,157
If the line is in the centre,

149
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,807
for example in an idle animation,

150
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,807
then neither foot is more stable.

151
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,926
For a smooth transition

152
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:41,926
try to get the lines to match up.

153
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,606
If neither foot is more stable

154
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:46,606
then this is less important.

155
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,805
You can move the two states 

156
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:51,805
back and forth in the graph

157
00:06:51,805 --> 00:06:53,971
to adjust at what points the transition

158
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,971
starts and ends.

159
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,175
Below the graph is where we specify

160
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,175
the conditions that will cause this

161
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:02,322
transition to run.

162
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,946
By default transitions have a

163
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,946
condition of an exit time.

164
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,334
This means that once the animation

165
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,949
of a state is a portion of the way through

166
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,498
it will transition to the next state.

167
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,736
Conditions are generally dependent on parameters,

168
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:22,191
for example a Bool parameter being true or false

169
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,191
or a float parameter being greater than

170
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:26,770
or less than some constant value.

171
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,698
A transition can have multiple conditions

172
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,907
if required.

Click the + button to create more.

174
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:37,878
At the bottom of the Inspector

175
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:39,712
there is a preview window for viewing

176
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:41,948
what the transitions look like.

177
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,116
It is possible to have multiple transitions

178
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:51,587
to and from the same state.

179
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,753
Generally this is used to have multiple

180
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:57,089
sets of conditions for the same transition.

181
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,902
Consider having a Speed parameter

182
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:02,857
and two states Idle and Run.

183
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,550
To have the condition that you transition

184
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,619
from Idle to Run

185
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:09,619
when Speed is not 0

186
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,884
you could create two transitions

187
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,479
and have the conditions be

188
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,479
Speed is greater than .1

189
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:21,653
and Speed is less than -.1

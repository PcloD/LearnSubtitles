00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:04,138
In Unity we can utilise the built-in navigation system

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:07,431
to give our characters intelligent and accurate movement.

3
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,807
Using this system we can have player

4
00:00:09,807 --> 00:00:11,807
and non-player characters alike

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,872
moving around in our 3D environments in no time.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,860
Traditional navigation around 3D objects in a scene

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,498
is slow and inefficient due to the complexities of the models.

8
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:27,154
That is why Unity employs something called a Navmesh.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,484
A navmesh is a very simply 3D mesh which is derived

10
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:35,420
from the geometry of more complicated elements in a scene.

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,275
This more basic navmesh is much easier to

12
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:41,814
navigate and path-find within.

13
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:44,950
The process of creating a navmesh,

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,491
often called baking,

15
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:48,491
is achieved through the navigation view

16
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:50,657
in the Unity editor.

17
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:53,172
For more information on baking meshes

18
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,172
see the lesson linked below.

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,990
Once the navmesh has been created

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,529
a navmesh agent component allows any game object

21
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,710
to find a path around the scene and move accordingly.

22
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,186
Simply apply the component and tell it where to go

23
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:11,102
using the navmesh agent's scripting AVI.

24
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,441
For more information on navmesh agent components

25
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,441
see the lesson linked below.

26
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,190
Navigation can also be enhanced

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,190
by the use of off-mesh links to control

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,066
movement across meshes

29
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:26,234
and navmesh obstacles to get in your character's way.

30
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,734
For more information on off-mesh links

31
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,734
and navmesh obstacles can be found

32
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:32,734
in the lessons linked below.

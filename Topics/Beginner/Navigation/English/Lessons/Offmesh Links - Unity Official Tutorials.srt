1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,882
Many times in Unity you will want to connect

2
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:04,882
2 navmeshes together to allow characters

3
00:00:04,882 --> 00:00:06,882
to move between them.

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,882
For example, you may want to allow

5
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:11,471
a character to jump over a gap in the ground

6
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:13,471
or drop down from an elevated height.

7
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:17,808
We can achieve this effect using off mesh links.

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:20,405
Off mesh links are pathways

9
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,405
that connect pieces of a navmesh

10
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:24,729
so that navmesh agents can traverse them.

11
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:27,586
For more information on navmesh agents

12
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:29,586
see the lesson linked below.

13
00:00:30,794 --> 00:00:33,525
We can create off mesh links in 2 ways.

14
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,863
We can either allow Unity to generate them automatically

15
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:38,863
or we can manually place them with the

16
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:40,863
off mesh link component.

17
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:43,849
Here we have a scene that has a capsule

18
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:45,849
with a navmesh agent attached.

19
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,835
The capsule also has a script

20
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:50,835
that will make the agent move towards

21
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,835
a target game object.

22
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:56,395
As you can see the target game object

23
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:58,548
is on the other side of a gap

24
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:01,503
and is thus on a different piece of navmesh.

25
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:06,563
In order to get Unity to generate off mesh links for us

26
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:09,164
we will need to select all navigationally

27
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:12,803
static object in our scene that we want links between.

28
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:17,570
In this case we will want to select the 2 storage boxes.

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,194
Once selected we will want to check the

30
00:01:20,194 --> 00:01:23,038
Off Mesh Link generation checkbox.

31
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:26,579
Next we will want to go in to the

32
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,221
Bake tab of the navigation view.

33
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:33,356
The 2 properties that affect Off Mesh Link generation

34
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:36,081
are Drop Height and Jump Distance.

35
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,737
Drop Height dictates how far of a drop

36
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:42,507
is an acceptable distance to create a link.

37
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,552
For example it would be reasonable to be

38
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:48,686
able to drop off of a box, but not a skyscraper.

39
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:52,650
The Jump Distance determines how far of a gap

40
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,775
an off mesh link can span.

41
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:57,397
Once again, the bigger the number

42
00:01:57,397 --> 00:02:01,294
the further an agent can jump from one navmesh to another.

43
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,531
By default these are set to 0

44
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,531
so we will want to set them to something that

45
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:08,531
makes sense for our scene.

46
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,007
It is worth noting that in order to have Unity

47
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,007
generate off mesh links you will need

48
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,793
to disable the Height Mesh property.

49
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:19,451
When you're done setting your properties

50
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:22,238
you will simply click the Bake button.

51
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:24,654
You will see any generated off mesh links

52
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:26,265
in the scene view.

53
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:29,850
If we run our scene we can see that the agent

54
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,850
is now able to traverse the gap

55
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,850
and reach it's destination.

56
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,850
The second way to create off mesh links

57
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,055
is manually with the Off Mesh Link Component.

58
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:43,308
Creating links this way gives us better control

59
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:46,308
over where they are placed and how we can interact with them.

60
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,641
Here we have the same scene as before

61
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:53,514
except we have removed the generated off mesh links

62
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,263
and added 2 new empty game objects

63
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:59,952
which are named LinkStart and LinkEnd.

64
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,687
These will be the game objects

65
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,687
that we create our link between.

66
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:09,261
To add an off mesh link component to an object

67
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:12,432
click the Add Component button and select

68
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:15,117
Navigation - Off Mesh Link.

69
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,065
The first 2 properties of the off mesh link component

70
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,007
Start and End require the game objects

71
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,731
that will represent the start and end of our link.

72
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:28,479
This means that the component doesn't have to be

73
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,546
on an object that is part of the link.

74
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:34,130
Though organisationally it is a good idea.

75
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:38,496
The Cost Override is used to adjust

76
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:41,817
the cost of the link for the purposes of calculating a path.

77
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:45,278
If this property is not a positive number

78
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:47,278
it will be ignored and the default

79
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:49,278
value will be used.

80
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,470
Bi Directional dictates whether or not

81
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,470
a character can traverse in both directions

82
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,470
across a link.

83
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,403
The Activated property allows you to

84
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,403
turn a link on and off.

85
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:06,100
Auto Update Positions determines whether or not the link

86
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
will be updated if either of the

87
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,514
start or end transforms are modified.

88
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:14,504
The Navigation Layer is the layer that the

89
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,418
off mesh link belongs to

90
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:19,456
For more information on Navigation Layers

91
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:22,857
see the lesson on NavMesh Baking linked below.

92
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,197
It is worth noting that once you have setup

93
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,986
your off mesh link component

94
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:30,400
you do not need to rebake your navmesh.

95
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:34,097
The link will automatically be visible on the navmesh

96
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:36,097
when you open the navigation view.

97
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,578
We can now run our scene and see

98
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,578
the agent move across our newly

99
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,770
created off mesh link.

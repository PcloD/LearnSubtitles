1
00:00:00,221 --> 00:00:03,194
In order to get our characters navigating around a scene

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:05,194
we first need to create a navmesh.

3
00:00:05,636 --> 00:00:08,771
The act of creating a navmesh is called baking.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,268
In Unity we can create a navmesh

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:14,268
using the navigation view.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,710
To open the navigation view

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,710
click Window - Navigation.

8
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:22,181
The navigation view, like any other

9
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:25,824
window in Unity is fully resizable and dockable.

10
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,843
We can see that the navigation view is

11
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:30,601
broken up in to 3 tabs.

12
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,690
Object, Bake and Layers.

13
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:37,539
In order to bake a navmesh we must tell Unity

14
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,433
which objects are navigation static.

15
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,345
This means that those objects don't move

16
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:47,377
and can be used to calculate the walkable areas in a scene.

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,723
Objects that are usually navigation static

18
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:54,332
are things like floors, walls and static obstacles.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,389
We specify these objects in the Object tab 

20
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:02,209
on the navigation view by selecting the game object we want

21
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,799
and checking Navigation Status.

22
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:07,497
Alternatively we can set the

23
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:09,497
game object to navigation static

24
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:12,015
in the inspector view by clicking the

25
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:15,786
Static dop down and selecting Navigations Static.

26
00:01:17,382 --> 00:01:19,382
The Off mesh Link generation

27
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:23,040
check box determines whether or not Unity will attempt

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
to create offmesh links.

29
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:27,492
More information on offmesh links

30
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:29,894
can be found in the lesson linked below.

31
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:34,357
Finally you can choose a navigation layer

32
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,787
for the selected object.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,081
By default there are 3 layers,

34
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:42,697
default, not walkable and jump.

35
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:45,322
Layers will be covered in greater detail

36
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,322
later in this video.

37
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:50,430
We will want to continue applying the navigation

38
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,922
static checkbox to every game object

39
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:55,652
that should be factored in when calculating a navmesh.

40
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,508
We can use filters to change how

41
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:01,084
the objects appear in the hierarchy view

42
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:03,805
so that selecting objects becomes easier.

43
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,670
All will show us all objects.

44
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,150
Mesh Renderers will show us the objects that have

45
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,150
a mesh renderer component.

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,683
And Terrains will show us any terrain in the scene.

47
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:20,048
The Layers tab is where you can create and edit

48
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,048
different navigation layers.

49
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,856
Besides the 3 built-in layers

50
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:27,487
we can create several user-defined layers.

51
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,448
These layers can be given different cost

52
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:32,719
which will be factored in to navigation.

53
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:36,842
For instance, the default layer could constitute

54
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:39,483
a road where travelling is easy.

55
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:41,483
It has a cost of 1.

56
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,031
You could also have a Mud layer

57
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,031
which is much more difficult to walk on

58
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,688
and give it a weight of 3 for example.

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,543
This means that when calculating a path

60
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,862
characters are more likely to avoid objects

61
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,862
set to the Mud Layer because

62
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:59,862
it is more difficult to walk on.

63
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:03,218
The Bake tab is where we choose

64
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:05,218
our navmesh properties.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
The radius determines close a character

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,795
can get to a wall or other obstacle.

67
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:15,019
It also defines the narrowest path a character can walk on

68
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,019
The Height property dictates how tall

69
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,019
the ceiling must be a for character

70
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,151
to walk below it.

71
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:24,926
For instance, even if there is a clear path

72
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:28,358
the ceiling might be too low for a character to pass.

73
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,275
Max Slope allows you to specify how steep

74
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,275
a slope must be before it is considered

75
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:37,041
a wall, and thus impassable.

76
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:39,954
The Step Height property determines

77
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,954
how tall an individual step or

78
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,712
bump can be before it will block a character.

79
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:48,182
The generated offmesh links properties

80
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:51,250
will be covered in detail in the lesson linked below.

81
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,020
There are also a few advanced settings you can use

82
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,661
but the defaults are fine for most situations.

83
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:02,128
The Min Region Area specifies the minimum area

84
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,128
a surface must have for it to be

85
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,128
included in the navmesh.

86
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,112
The Inaccuracy % properties

87
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,112
allows you to specify how accurate or

88
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:14,005
inaccurate the mesh will be around it's edges.

89
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,074
Finally you can choose to also have

90
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:19,074
a height mesh created.

91
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:21,479
This will improve movement accuracy

92
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,768
though it will make generation slower.

93
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,998
Once all of our properties are set

94
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:28,998
we will want to click the Bake button.

95
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,450
This will generate our navmesh.

96
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,450
When complete the navmesh will appear

97
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,134
as a blue layer.

98
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:37,769
All areas that are blue are walkable.

99
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:41,611
You should note that if you don't see the blue layer,

100
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:43,611
you should insure the show navmesh

101
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:46,111
option in the scene view is checked.

1
00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:02,375
Game objects that are part of a navmesh

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:05,337
are a great way to build static walls in to a scene.

3
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:07,818
But what if we wanted moving object

4
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:09,818
that would block a character's path?

5
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:12,308
For that we would want to use

6
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:14,308
a navmesh obstacle.

7
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:18,690
Unlike game objects that are marked as navigation static

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,787
and baked in to a navmesh

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,787
navmesh obstacles are able to

10
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:24,787
block paths dynamically.

11
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:27,758
Some examples of navmesh obstacles 

12
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:31,273
might be openable doors or moving blockades.

13
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,196
For more information on navmeshes

14
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:38,292
see the lesson on navmesh baking linked below.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,792
Here we have a scene with a capsule in it.

16
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:45,140
The capsule has a navmesh agent attached.

17
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:47,573
The capsule also has a script on it

18
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,849
that will move it towards our target game object.

19
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,275
For more information on navmesh agents

20
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,275
see the lesson linked below.

21
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:00,605
Also in our scene is a teddy bear model.

22
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:04,639
This teddy bear is not navigation static

23
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:07,883
and therefore is not baked in to the navmesh.

24
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:11,194
Still, we would like this teddy bear

25
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:15,124
to block the path of any navmesh agents in our scene.

26
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,374
To add a navmesh obstacle

27
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:20,374
component to a game object

28
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:23,814
click the Add Component button and select

29
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:26,848
Navigation - Nav Mesh Obstacle

30
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:29,748
The Radius and Height properties of the

31
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:31,748
navmesh obstacle component

32
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,748
determine the dimensions of the cylinder

33
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:36,109
that will block the character's path.

34
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:40,758
We will talk about the Move Threshold property in a moment.

35
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:44,488
The Carve option determines whether or not

36
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:47,620
the obstacle will create a temporary hole in a navmesh.

37
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,758
With this selected we can see that the obstacle

38
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:54,313
creates an impassable spot in our navmesh.

39
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,120
The way this works is thus.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Let's say that a navmesh obstacle

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
is blocking a narrow walkway.

42
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:06,194
If Carve is selected a navmesh agent 

43
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:09,735
will avoid that walkway when calculating it's path.

44
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,652
If Carve is not selected

45
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:15,938
then the agent may attempt to travel that pathway

46
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:17,938
but it will not be able to pass.

47
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,285
The Move Threshold property

48
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:24,317
is only used if Carve is enabled.

49
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,886
This property dictates how far

50
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:28,886
the navmesh obstacle must move

51
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,886
before the hole in the navmesh

52
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,886
is recalculated.

53
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,469
With an obstacle in the way

54
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:37,469
we can run our scene.

55
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,942
We will notice that the navmesh agent

56
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:44,801
avoids the obstacle while moving towards it's target.

00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,744
Most smartphones and tablets have something known

2
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:04,744
as an accelerometer.

3
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,244
This can be used to find out information

4
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:11,665
about the physical orientation of the device as we use it.

5
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:15,308
This information is accessed through a vector3 property

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:19,489
called acceleration, which is a part of the input class.

7
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,528
The axis of the accelerometer are setup

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,277
to match the axis in Unity.

9
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:27,711
Therefore Y is the vertical axis,

10
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,003
X is the horizontal axis,

11
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,280
and Z is the depth axis.

12
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:35,276
This holds true regardless of whether you are

13
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:37,276
in portrait or landscape mode.

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,175
Unity automatically adjusts the accelerometer input

15
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,175
to match the device's orientation.

16
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:47,422
Here we have a scene in Unity with a cube in in.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,505
The cube has a script called 

18
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:52,002
Accelerometer Input attached.

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,486
Inside the accelerometer input script

20
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:57,486
we can see that in the update method we are

21
00:00:57,486 --> 00:01:01,704
moving the cube based on the Input.acceleration vector3.

22
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,697
We have mapped the accelerometer's X axis

23
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:09,345
to the cube's X axis.

24
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:11,553
And we have mapped the negative of the

25
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:16,297
accelerometer's Z axis to the cube's Z axis.

26
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,567
The values of the accelerometer's axis

27
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:23,106
range from -1 to 1 and so we can use it 

28
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:26,371
in the same manner as input.getAxis.

29
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,383
When we build and deploy our project

30
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:31,881
we can see that by tilting our mobile device

31
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:34,841
we are able to move the cube around the scene.

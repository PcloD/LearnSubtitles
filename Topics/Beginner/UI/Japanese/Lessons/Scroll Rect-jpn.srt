00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:04,883
The Scroll Rect is a UI element that allows the

2
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:06,883
user to move another UI element along

3
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:09,607
the horizontal and/or vertical axis

4
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,397
This is usually a large image or a

5
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:14,911
panel of other UI elements, such as a list of

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,911
buttons or a large block of text.

7
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,074
This scroll rect is most often used

8
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:22,074
with a mask element.

9
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,939
And is designed to work seamlessly with scroll bars.

10
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:29,275
Masks and scroll bars with be covered in this lesson,

11
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:30,723
but only briefly.

12
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,347
For more detailed information on masks

13
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:36,959
and scroll bars please see the information linked below.

14
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:39,269
To create a scroll rect

15
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:41,269
add a scroll rect script to a game

16
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,000
object that is the child of canvas.

17
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:46,624
Like all UI elements, the scroll rect

18
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:48,624
must be the child of a  canvas/

19
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:51,538
One way to add the scroll rect's script

20
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:55,866
to the game object is to use Add Component.

21
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,056
 UI

22
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,376
Scroll Rect.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,472
For this example, the game object

24
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:07,134
will be renamed Scroll View.

25
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:10,851
Content is a referent to the rect transform

26
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:14,028
on the UI element being controlled be the scroll rect.
Associate
27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,610
For example an image far larger

28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,513
than the scroll rect.

29
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:21,124
Associate the content, in this case

30
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,601
the large image

31
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,482
with the content property on the scroll rect.

32
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,847
When in play mode this content is fully scrollable.

33
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:34,704
The scroll rect is commonly used with a mask element

34
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:38,016
To use a mask element with a scroll rect

35
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,016
first add an image script to the game object

36
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,016
for the mask to use.

37
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:45,966
And then add a mask script.

38
00:01:50,957 --> 00:01:52,957
The mask element will use the image to

39
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,684
create it's mask

40
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:58,082
As specific image is not needed on the image script.

41
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,609
But one can be added for additional

42
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,609
control over the shape of the mask.

43
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,573
For more information on the image and mask elements

44
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,905
please see the information linked below.

45
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:13,112
Horizontal and vertical enables scrolling

46
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,681
along those axis.

47
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,670
To disable scrolling along one axis

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,143
set that axis property to false.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,818
Movement type describes the scrolling mode.

50
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,580
The scrolling mode can be chosen by the 

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,580
movement type pop-up menu.

52
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:32,955
Unrestricted allows for unrestricted scrolling movement.

53
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:35,538
This is not a common mode to choose

54
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,538
and it is entirely possible without

55
00:02:37,538 --> 00:02:39,049
some additional method

56
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,919
to lose the content in a way that is irretrievable.

57
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,780
This mode however may prove to be useful

58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,305
under certain circumstances.

59
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,722
When using either elastic or clamped

60
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:51,303
as the movement type

61
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:54,137
the content cannot leave the bounds of the scroll rect

62
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:56,137
on any of the scrollable axis.

63
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:58,430
In these two modes,

64
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,136
for the content to be scrollable,

65
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,136
the rect transform of the content must

66
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:05,131
be larger than the rect transform of the scroll rect.

67
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:07,949
If the rect transform of the content is

68
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,113
smaller than the rect transform of the scroll rect

69
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:13,911
it cannot be scrolled along that axis.

70
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:17,708
When positioning the content in either of these modes

71
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,708
it is best to position the content so

72
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,237
that it starts within the bounds of the scroll rect

73
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,237
or undesirable behaviour may occur.

74
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,237
as the rect transform tries to bring the

75
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,444
content back within it's bounds.

76
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:31,848
When using the movement type Elastic

77
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:33,848
the content will bounce when it reaches the

78
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,848
bounds of the scroll rect.

79
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:39,453
The amount of bounce is set by the

80
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,453
elasticity property.

81
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,030
When using the movement type Clamped

82
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,030
the content will not bounce when it reaches the

83
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,517
bounds, it will simply stop scrolling.

84
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,549
Inertia defines whether or not the 

85
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,549
content will continue to glide when releasing

86
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:59,549
the pointer after a  drag.

87
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:02,477
When inertia is false the content

88
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:04,477
will only move when dragged.

89
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,060
If inertia is set to true the

90
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
content will continue to glide after the pointer

91
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,644
has ended the drag.

92
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:13,394
How soon the content stops gliding

93
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:16,748
is determined by the deceleration rate property.

94
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:19,248
A deceleration rate of 0 means

95
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,248
the gliding will stop instantly.

96
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,190
The value of 1 means the gliding will

97
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,190
never slow down.

98
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,690
Horizontal and vertical scroll bars

99
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,271
are optional references to potential scroll bar elements.

100
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,351
To use scroll bars with a scroll rects

101
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,056
simply create the scroll bars needed,

102
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,581
position them,

103
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,468
and associate the scroll bars with properties

104
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,468
on the scroll rect.

105
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:51,413
They will work automatically.

106
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:54,867

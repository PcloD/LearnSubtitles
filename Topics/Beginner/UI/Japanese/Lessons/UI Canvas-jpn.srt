1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,740
canvas は、UI要素のグループが

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,074
レンダリングされる方法を制御するコンポーネントです。

3
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:11,900
すべてのUI要素は、canvas の子でなければなりません。

4
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:16,780
シーン内に複数の canvas を持つことも可能です。

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,429
UI要素を使用するためには、少なくとも1つの使用可能な

6
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,596
canvas が存在する必要があります。

7
00:00:21,596 --> 00:00:23,513
If a new UI element is created 

8
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:25,443
and no canvas exists

9
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,443
a new canvas will be created

10
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:29,443
and the new UI element will be attached

11
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:31,443
to that canvas as a child.

12
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,703
Each canvas has a number of different

13
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,703
possible render modes.

14
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,203
The render mode can be set by using

15
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,203
the Render Mode pop-up menu.

16
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:44,729
Scene Space - Overlay is the most common render mode

17
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,549
and it is the default render mode setting

18
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:47,923
for a canvas.

19
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,731
With Screen Space - Overlay selected

20
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,731
the UI will overlay the scene.

21
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,231
And all of the UI elements will be drawn

22
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:58,197
on top of 
everything else rendered in that scene.

23
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,056
In this mode the canvas will

24
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,056
fill the screen automatically

25
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,056
and will resize automatically if

26
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:07,056
the screen settings change.

27
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,382
It is worth noting that in Screen Space - Overlay mode

28
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:18,441
the canvas will drive the Rect Transform component.

29
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:20,941
And the entire rect transform component

30
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,447
is uneditable.

31
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,041
The canvas will set all of the values

32
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:28,430
in the rect transform to fill the screen automatically.

33
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:32,122
For more information on the rect transform component

34
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:34,696
please see the information linked below.

35
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,973
This render mode has the option of Pixel Perfect.

36
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:42,064
When Pixel Perfect is selected UI elements

37
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:45,407
will be adjusted to the nearest pixel when they are rendered.

38
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,720
Which can, in some cases, sharpen the look

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
of the UI element.

40
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:52,662
Screen Space - Camera is very similar

41
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:54,662
to Screen Space - Overlay.

42
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:57,051
It is, however, rendered by a specific

43
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,051
camera in the scene.

44
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:01,550
This will allow camera-specific settings to be

45
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,802
applied to a screen space UI.

46
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,701
The most common being the use of a perspective camera

47
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,037
to give the UI a feeling of depth.

48
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,058
In this mode the canvas will fill the

49
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:20,419
camera's viewport automatically

50
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,419
and will resize automatically if the camera's

51
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,419
viewport settings change.

52
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:33,314
In this render mode the rect transform

53
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:36,419
is also being driven entirely by the canvas.

54
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,913
This render mode has several options,

55
00:02:39,913 --> 00:02:41,732
including Pixel Perfect,

56
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:44,843
which acts just the same as in screen space - overlay.

57
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:47,302
Render Camera is for setting the camera

58
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:50,172
that will render the UI elements on this canvas.

59
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:53,128
If this is none, the canvas component will use the

60
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,128
screen space - overlay settings

61
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,839
to render this canvas.

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,834
When Screen Space - Camera is selected

63
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,779
and a camera is assigned to the canvas component

64
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:04,779
the UI elements will be moved

65
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:08,035
in to the camera's frustum and resized to fit.

66
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:10,978
This allows for the UI to be rendered relative

67
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:12,978
to game object in the scene view.

68
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,166
To control where in the scene the UI

69
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,298
elements will be rendered use Plane Distance

70
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,118
to move the canvas closer to,

71
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,449
or further away from, the camera.

72
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,853
The canvas and it's UI elements will be

73
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,407
automatically resized to fit the frustum

74
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,983
based on their position in front of the camera.

75
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:33,318
It is worth noting that the plane distance must

76
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:35,318
be within the rendering camera's near and far

77
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,318
clipping planes to be rendered.

78
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,578
When using Screen Space - Camera

79
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:44,168
the canvas can be rendered by any camera in the scene.

80
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,931
To isolate a canvas and it's contents

81
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:49,481
from any other cameras rendering the scene

82
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,032
use the camera's clear flags culling mask

83
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,285
and depth properties.

84
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,785
For more information on how to use these

85
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,785
camera properties please see the information

86
00:03:57,785 --> 00:04:00,387
on cameras linked below.

87
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,030
Render Mode World Space renders UI elements

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,808
in the scene volume.

89
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:08,908
These UI elements could be static objects in the scene

90
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,908
or mobile objects like speech bubbles

91
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:14,324
or player tags that follow game objects in the scene.

92
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:18,429
The first thing to note about a canvas in world space mode

93
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:22,030
is that the canvas no longer drives the rect transform

94
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,236
and the canvas can be set anywhere in world space.

95
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,736
With the understanding that there can be more than

96
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:30,604
one canvas in the scene it is not uncommon to go

97
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,399
create new world space canvas' as necessary for

98
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,704
world space UI elements.

99
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,314
Event Camera is required to received

100
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,646
events and determine which camera will be used

101
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:49,001
to detect events like clicking on a UI element.

102
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:52,946
In most cases, with screen space world selected

103
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,766
this event camera will be the camera rendering the scene.

104
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,846
Receives Events indicates whether the

105
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,846
UI elements on this canvas will

106
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:04,560
receive events like clicks and hovers.

107
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,350
Disable this property to ignore events on

108
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,363
all UI elements that are children of this canvas.

109
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:13,346
Sorting Order and Order in Layer are

110
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,858
for controlling the render order of the canvas

111
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,812
when compared to other renderers in the scene.

112
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:21,502
Sorting Order and Order in Layer are exposed on the

113
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:23,502
canvas component and are available for

114
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:26,181
canvas' set to either screen space - camera

115
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,767
or world space.

116
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,336
For more information on Sorting Layers

117
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:34,278
and Order in Layer please see the information linked below.

118
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,455
UI elements on a canvas will be rendered

119
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:39,455
in a top-down order,

120
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,422
where the first items are rendered at the back

121
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,896
and lower items are rendered later and appear on top.

122
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,492
To change the order in which a UI element renders

123
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,995
simply change it's order in the hierarchy

1
00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:03,014
The image component is used to give UI elements

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:05,359
actual graphical presence on the screen.

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,890
Images can be used to make up the backgrounds of

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,887
buttons, panels, sliders and literally anything you want

5
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:12,997
to put in to your UI composition.

6
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:16,134
The first property of an image component is the source image.

7
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:18,938
This is a reference to the sprite that the image

8
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:22,398
is displaying, when using None, the color will be used

9
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:24,782
to represent the outline of the image.

10
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:26,962
Here we simply have a white image color,

11
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:29,183
so let's add a sprite to our source image.

12
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:31,471
The next property is the color.

13
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,121
This color is multiplied to the color of the sprite.

14
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,121
As such it can be used for fading

15
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,121
or tinting a sprite.

16
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:48,459
By default an images doesn't need a material.

17
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:50,459
But one can be added if you wish to use the

18
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,459
properties of a shader on the image.

19
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,141
Note that the texture property of a material

20
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,433
will be ignored.

21
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,641
Unity provides a number of shaders that can be

22
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,434
used with the UI system.

23
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:03,851
To use them create a material

24
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,851
and for it's Shader property select

25
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:09,236
one from the uGUI menu in the Shader drop-down.

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,490
The Image Type property effects how

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,075
the source image is used

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,075
and has a number of options.

29
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:19,768
Simple means that the sprite will just stretch to

30
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:21,768
fit the rect transform's size.

31
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:24,586
The Preserve Aspect option here simply means

32
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,586
that the image will be as large as it can be

33
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,365
within it's bounding rect,

34
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,365
but maintaining the aspect ratio that

35
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,738
it was imported with.

36
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,151
This means that it won't lose it's original proportions

37
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:35,615
as it's resized.

38
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:37,615
The Set Native Size button is available

39
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:39,615
whilst using this option also.

40
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:41,825
It will revert the rect transform's size

41
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,991
to the size of the sprite in it's source image.

42
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,479
Here you can see that our rect has been reverted

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,936
to the 64 square size of our sprite.

44
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,016
Sliced means that the image will be displayed

45
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,016
using the 9 sliced method.

46
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:56,516
A 9 sliced sprite is separated

47
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,237
in to 9 sections in a grid pattern.

48
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:02,146
The outer border sections of this grid do not stretch

49
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:03,688
whilst the centre does,

50
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,022
allowing for scaling without distortion of the edges.

51
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:09,442
These sections are defined by the Borders Set

52
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,442
in the sprite editor for the texture.

53
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:13,828
For more information on the sprite editor

54
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,828
see the information linked below.

55
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,271
The Sliced option also has another property

56
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:20,540
Fill Centre.

57
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,967
This toggles whether or not the centre section

58
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,325
of the 09 sliced sprite is shown.

59
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,325
This allows you to design and render

60
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,325
borders only of an image.

61
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,530
The Tiled option will tile the source image

62
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,999
starting from the lower-left corner of the rect.

63
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,812
In this example we're using an un-sliced sprite.

64
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,688
The next image type is Filled.

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,661
This type allows you to show a proportion of the image

66
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,936
defined by the Fill Amount property.

67
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,712
At 0 none of the image will be shown

68
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:49,712
and at 1 all of it will be.

69
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,212
There are a number of sub-options when using

70
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,629
the filled image type.

71
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:55,629
The Fill Method along with the Fill Origin

72
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,206
determine which point represents the fill amount being 0

73
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:01,206
and in which direction the image will fill

74
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:02,900
as it increases.

75
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:06,261
For radial fill methods the fill origin defines

76
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:08,610
where the fill will be carried out from.

77
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,639
For the radial fill methods there is also the

78
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,365
option to switch between clockwise and anti-clockwise.

79
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,699
These fills are ideal for making UI for

80
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,452
health bars or car speedometers

81
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,118
in the case of radial fills.

82
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:25,016
For more information on the image component

83
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:27,016

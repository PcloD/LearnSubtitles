1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:03,798
The Mask element is for creating a shaped mask

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:07,617
over any UI element or family of UI elements.

3
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:12,223
A mask is often used in conjunction with a scroll rect.

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:16,521
Scroll rect's are good for moving oversized elements.

5
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:20,094
A mask element is then used to clip this

6
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,774
oversized content to the desired size.

7
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:26,162
For more information on the scroll rect

8
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:28,551
please see the information linked below.

9
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,733
Two items are needed to create a working mask.

10
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,763
A mask element, to create the mask,

11
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:39,007
and an image element to define the shape of the mask.

12
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,755
A graphical element does not need to be 

13
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:44,999
assigned to the image for the mask to work.

14
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,915
If no graphical element is assigned

15
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,915
the mask will use the bounds of the

16
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:52,748
rect transform to clip the contents.

17
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,218
To change the shape of the mask

18
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:57,218
change the graphical element.

19
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:06,446
Show Mask Graphic is a toggle

20
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,446
and will toggle whether or not the graphical

21
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:10,446
element is displayed.

22
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,208
The graphical element does not need to be shown

23
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,835
for the mask to work.

24
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:18,288

1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,825
The scrollbar allows users to select a numeric value

2
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:09,665
from 0 to 1 by dragging the handle of the scrollbar.

3
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,703
Scrollbars are usually used to set or change a value

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:16,134
on another UI element or component.

5
00:00:16,963 --> 00:00:19,663
Scrollbars are commonly used with a scroll rect,

6
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:21,663
which can hold and mask contents

7
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,663
too large to be easily viewed.

8
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,661
The scroll rect will use the value from the

9
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:29,593
scrollbar to control how it's contents are scrolled.

10
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:33,060
For more information on scroll rects

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,422
please see the information linked below.

12
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,680
The scrollbar's value is set by the position of

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,339
the handle along the length of the scrollbar.

14
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,495
The value is a normalised value that starts at

15
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:46,884
0 at one end of the scrollbar

16
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:50,210
and increases up to 1 at the other end.

17
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:54,570
A value of 0.5 indicates the halfway point.

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,754
To create a new scrollbar use the Create 

19
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:03,210
menu to Create - UI - Scrollbar.

20
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:07,217
like all UI elements, the scrollbar element

21
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:09,217
must be the child of a canvas.

22
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:12,339
If one is not present when creating a pre-made

23
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,292
scrollbar a new canvas will be created.

24
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:18,111
For more information on the canvas

25
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,111
please see the information linked below.

26
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:23,609
When the scrollbar is created it is made from a

27
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,609
family of game objects.

28
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:29,328
The children are the rect transform and image components

29
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:32,495
that define the sliding area and the handle graphic.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,340
The parent game object is where the required

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,340
scrollbar script resides.

32
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:41,382
The background image is a component on the parent game object.

33
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,922
Interact-able determines whether or not this particular

34
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,922
scrollbar will accept input.

35
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,753
To prevent interaction with a scrollbar

36
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:53,029
set Interact-able to false.

37
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,931
When interact-able is set to false

38
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:58,112
the transition state for the scrollbar element

39
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:00,513
will be set to the disabled state.

40
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,550
By default the scrollbar element will display

41
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,855
the normal state of the scrollbar.

42
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:08,922
Depending upon the transition mode chosen

43
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,406
a scrollbar can also display a highlighted

44
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,406
pressed and disabled state.

45
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,252
Transition Mode determines whether or not the

46
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:19,776
scrollbar element will display any of these additional states,

47
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,527
and if so controls the slider's look in each state

48
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,589
and the style of the transitions between the states.

49
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:29,517
The transition mode property is shared

50
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,517
by many UI elements and will be

51
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,517
covered in it's own lesson.

52
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,253
For more information on transitions and the

53
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,253
transition mode property please see the

54
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,990
information linked below.

55
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:42,989
When using transitions with a scrollbar

56
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,419
it is worth noting that, with the exception of

57
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,628
the animation transition mode,

58
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,833
any visual changes are only seen in the handle graphic

59
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,833
not the rest of the UI element.

60
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:55,803
Navigation describes how the selection

61
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:57,803
of UI elements is handled when using

62
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,453
keyboard or controller input.

63
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,787
Navigation is shared by many UI elements

64
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:05,149
and will be covered in it's own lesson.

65
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:08,396
For most circumstances navigation can simply

66
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,396
be set to automatic.

67
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:13,186
For more information on navigation

68
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,559
please see the information linked below.

69
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:18,807
Handle rect is a reference to the rect transform

70
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,807
on the graphic used for the handle.

71
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,528
Direction sets both the axis and

72
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,528
the direction of the value changed.

73
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,527
The value is a normalised value that starts with 0

74
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,859
at one end of the scrollbar and increasing

75
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,859
up to 1 at the other end.

76
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,859
For example, with the choice of left to right,

77
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:42,319
the starting value of 0 will be at the left of the scrollbar

78
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,667
and the value of the scrollbar will increase

79
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:48,069
proportionally as the handle moves from left to right

80
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,069
with a value of 1 at the right.

81
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:52,928
The choices for direction are

82
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:54,961
LeftToRight,

83
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:56,606
RightToLeft,

84
00:03:57,216 --> 00:04:00,169
BottomToTop and TopToBottom.

85
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,962
The value is the current value of the scrollbar

86
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:08,070
When the value is set in the inspector during edit time

87
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,977
this will set the starting value for the scrollbar.

88
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,686
Size is the fractional size of the

89
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,686
handle within the scrollbar,

90
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:17,896
in a range of 0 to 1.

91
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,548
Number of steps is the number of distinct

92
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,129
positions allowed by the scrollbar.

93
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:27,681
For a smooth continuous scroll

94
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,680
set this value to 0 or 1.

95
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:35,788
The UI framework contains a powerful events system

96
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,213
This is created when the canvas is created.

97
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,978
When the event system detects a click

98
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:43,978
or a drag on the scrollbar

99
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,381
the event system will call an OnValueChanged event.

100
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,047
The scrollbar component includes a built-in

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,379
on value changed function list

102
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,379
that contains a list of all the functions

103
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,205
that are called when the scroll values change.

104
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,094
Additional events can be detected and used

105
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,094
by the scrollbar element ,  but this requires

106
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,094
an additional component.

107
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,188
For more information on how to use the build in

108
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:11,537
function's list, events, the event system and event triggers

109
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,537
please see the information linked below.

110
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,548
In most cases the scrollbar will

111
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,548
be used with the scroll rect.

112
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,548
which will automatically use the dynamic

113
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:23,785
value of the scrollbar when they are associated.

114
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,742
For more information on the scroll rect

115
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:28,742
please see the information linked below.

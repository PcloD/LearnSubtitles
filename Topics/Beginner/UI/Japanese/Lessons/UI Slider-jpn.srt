1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,386
The Slider is a UI element

2
00:00:04,386 --> 00:00:07,390
that allows the user to select a numeric value

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,678
from a predetermined range of numbers

4
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:12,559
by dragging the handle of the slider control.

5
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,473
Common controls using a slider

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:20,142
include settings for audio volume, colour channels or brightness.

7
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,055
The slider element can also be repurposed

8
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:25,055
as a simple display for items like

9
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,796
health bars or volume meters.

10
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:31,074
The slider's value is set by the position

11
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:34,137
of the handle along the length of the slider.

12
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,358
The value starts at a minimum value

13
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:39,661
and increases up to a maximum value

14
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:42,231
defining a range between the two.

15
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:47,656
To create a new slider use the Create menu

16
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:51,990
to Create UI Slider.

17
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,006
Like all UI elements the slider element must be

18
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,006
the child of a canvas.

19
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,109
If one is not present when creating a pre-made slider

20
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:06,729
a new canvas will be created.

21
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:08,729
For more information on the canvas

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,244
please see the information linked below.

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,310
When the slider is created

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,135
it is made from a family of game objects.

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,828
The parent game object is where the required

26
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:21,828
slider script resides.

27
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,745
All of the children are the rect transform

28
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:26,745
and image components that make up the separate

29
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,745
elements of the slider control.

30
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:31,435
The elements that make up the slider

31
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:33,073
are the background graphic,

32
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:37,611
the fill graphic, which indicated the relative value chosen,

33
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,291
and the handle, which displays a

34
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,913
handle at the location of the chosen value.

35
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:46,371
The background and handle elements are optional.

36
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,617
Interact-able determines whether or not

37
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:52,446
this particular slider will accept input.

38
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:55,461
To prevent interaction with a slider

39
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:57,461
set Interact-able to false.

40
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,555
When interact-able is set to false

41
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,555
the transition state for the slider element

42
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,875
will be set to the disabled state.

43
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,956
By default the slider element will display

44
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:10,289
the normal state of the slider.

45
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,643
Depending upon the transition mode chosen

46
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,088
a slider can also display a highlighted,

47
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:18,088
pressed and disabled state.

48
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,643
Transition Mode determines whether or not

49
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:22,629
the slider element will display any of

50
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:24,435
these additional states

51
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,738
and if so controls the slider's look

52
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,738
for each state and the style of the 

53
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:30,738
transition between these states.

54
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,515
The transition mode property is shared

55
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,515
by many UI elements and will be covered

56
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,070
in it's own lesson.

57
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:39,794
For more information on transitions and

58
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,503
the transition mode property

59
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,724
please see the information linked below.

60
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,777
When using transitions with the slider element

61
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:48,777
it is worth noting that with the exception of

62
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:50,777
the animation transition

63
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,777
any visual change is only seen

64
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:56,539
on the handle graphic, not the rest of the UI element.

65
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,282
Navigation describes how the selection

66
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:02,282
of the UI elements is handled when using

67
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,282
keyboard or controller input.

68
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:07,171
Navigation is shared by many UI elements

69
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:09,171
and will be covered in it's own lesson.

70
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,237
For most circumstances navigation can

71
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,237
simply be set to Automatic.

72
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,441
For more information on navigation

73
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,441
please see the information linked below.

74
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,131
Fill Rect is a reference to the rect transform

75
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:26,428
on the graphic used for the filled area of the element.

76
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:29,204
The slider's current value is displayed

77
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,204
by the fill graphic.

78
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:34,444
Handle Rect is a reference to the rect transform

79
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:36,444
on the graphic used for the handle.

80
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:40,035
This is an optional reference and it can be none.

81
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,005
Direction sets both the axis and

82
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,681
the direction of the value change.

83
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:48,529
The Min Value will be at the

84
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,529
starting end of the direction.

85
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:53,237
For the choice of left to right

86
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,364
the min value will be at the left of the slider.

87
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,089
The value of the slider will increase proportionally as the

88
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,465
handle moves from left to right

89
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,986
and the Max value will be at the right.

90
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,467
The choices for direction are

91
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:14,229
LeftToRight, RightToLeft, BottomToTop and TopToBottom.

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,071
The range of the slider is determined by

93
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,071
the Min and Max values.

94
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:24,596
Min value is the minimum value of the range of the slider.

95
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,477
Max value is the maximum range of the slider.

96
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,932
Minimum value can be a negative number.

97
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,041
The minimum value however should be numerically

98
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,041
less than the maximum value

99
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,039
or aberrant behaviour could result with the slider.

100
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:43,627
Whole numbers will clamp the value of the slider to

101
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:47,167
whole numbers within the range from min to max value.

102
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,664
If the values in the min and max value

103
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:54,664
fields are not whole numbers

104
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:56,664
they will be adjusted to the closest whole

105
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,208
number when Whole Numbers is selected.

106
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:02,875
Value is the current value of the slider.

107
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,705
When value is set in the inspector during edit time

108
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,261
this will set the starting value for the slider.

109
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:15,316
The UI framework contains a powerful events system.

110
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:18,037
This is created automatically when the 

111
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,760
canvas is created.

112
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:22,537
When the event system detects the mass

113
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,189
down on the slider,

114
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,189
either a click or a drag,

115
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,808
the event system will call an OnValueChanged event.

116
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,518
The slider component includes a built-in

117
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:34,919
OnValueChanged function list

118
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,919
that contains a list of all the functions

119
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,711
that are called when the slider value changes.

120
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,252
Additional events can be detected

121
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,556
and used by the slider element, but this

122
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:47,297
requires an additional component to be attached.

123
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,271
For more information on how to use the

124
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:54,573
built-in function list, events, the event system and event triggers

125
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:56,948
please see the information linked below.

126
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,085
To hook up the current value of the slider

127
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,871
to a component, first create a new row in

128
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,302
the built-in OnValueChanged list.

129
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,089
Associate the game object when the desired

130
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,611
script or component attached to the first object field.

131
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:15,224
Then using the function pull-down menu

132
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,724
choose first the component

133
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,722
then an eligible function on that component to be called.

134
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:24,733
It is worth noting that ever time the value

135
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:27,583
of the slider changes the OnValueChanged

136
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,011
event will be called.

137
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
To parse the current value of the slider

138
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,345
the eligible function needs to have a float parameter.

139
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,899
And this function must be chosen from the dynamic float list.

140
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:41,606
This is done by selecting the function from

141
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:44,319
the top part of the list, indicated by the label

142
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,735
Dynamic Float.

143
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:48,543
If the only functions in the list are under

144
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:50,861
the header Static Parameters

145
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:52,861
this means the functions do not have a float

146
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,861
parameter and won't be able to accept

147
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,026
the current value of the slider element.

148
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:19,142
The final field is a parameter field

149
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:22,144
And when the current value of the slider

150
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:24,144
is parsed as a dynamic float

151
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,644
this field should be left blank.

152
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:30,354
It is worth noting that the value of the slider

153
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,354
element can also be driven externally,

154
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:34,854
and the slider will display the current value

155
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,854
sent to the slider.

156
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,846
One classic example of this is the

157
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:42,681
simple health, mana or fuel bar.

158
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:48,015
In a script with a reference to the slider element.

159
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
The slider value can be set.

160
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,351
In these cases it would be best to 

161
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,706
set the slider's interact-able value to false,

162
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:02,038
preventing any input on the slider.

163
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:07,031
And if desired, removing the handle graphic.

1
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,544
The transition property defines

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:07,641
how a UI element behaves in each state

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,618
and how it behaves when changing states.

4
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,615
The following lesson uses the button

5
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:16,549
element as an example, but transitions work the

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,523
same for each UI element with transitions.

7
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,751
By default the button element will display

8
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,751
the normal state of the button.

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,845
Depending upon the transition mode chosen

10
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:31,480
a button can also display a highlighted,

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,162
pressed and disabled state.

12
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:35,897
Transition Mode determines whether or not

13
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:37,897
the button element will display any of

14
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:39,690
these additional states

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,109
and if so controls the buttons look in each state

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,197
and the style of the transition between these states.

17
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,390
The highlighted state is set when the pointer is

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,390
hovering over the button element,

19
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,752
or the button element is selected using

20
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,752
keyboard or controller navigation.

21
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,639
The pressed state is when the button is

22
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:01,944
being held down, pressed but not released.

23
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,872
The disabled state is set when the button element

24
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:06,872
is not interact-able.

25
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:10,076
The look and behaviour of these other transition states,

26
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:13,464
if available, are determined by the transition mode.

27
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,231
The transition mode can be set with a

28
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,231
transition pop-up menu.

29
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,314
None will have no additional states

30
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,314
and therefore no transitions.

31
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:26,641
The button element will work as expected

32
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,641
but there will be no visual feedback

33
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,558
and the unaltered normal state will be

34
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,558
displayed at all times.

35
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,886
ColourTint is the default transition mode.

36
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,273
In this mode the same graphical element

37
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:42,273
is used for each state.

38
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,929
Target Graphic is the image component to be tinted.

39
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,922
Normal, Highlighted, Pressed and Disabled Colour

40
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,922
define the tint colour that will be applied

41
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:53,922
to the target graphic when the button

42
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,922
is in each of these states.

43
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:59,341
Colour Multiplier multiplies the tint colour

44
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,341
for each transition by it's value.

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,856
This allows for colours greater than 1,

46
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:06,856
which is useful for brightening the colours

47
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:09,671
or alpha channel on some graphic elements

48
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,988
who's base colour is less than white

49
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,988
or less than full alpha.

50
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,695
Fade Duration is the time in seconds

51
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:19,634
the transition takes between states.

52
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,109
Sprite Swap will use different sprite

53
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,109
images for each state

54
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,993
and swaps them depending upon the

55
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,355
state of the button.

56
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,021
In this mode a new graphical element

57
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,021
is required for each state.

58
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:37,815
Target Graphic is the image for the normal state.

59
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,439
The highlighted, pressed and disabled 

60
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,894
sprites are references to the sprite images

61
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,894
to be displayed for each state.

62
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,860
Animation allows for each transition to be

63
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,742
fully animated using Unity's animation system.

64
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:55,216
This is the most powerful of transition modes

65
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,520
due to the number of properties that can be

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,044
animated simultaneously.

67
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:02,048
To use the animation transition mode

68
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,048
an animator component needs to be attached

69
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:06,048
to the button element.

70
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,129
To add this animator component automatically

71
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,129
and generate an animator controller

72
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,336
with states already setup

73
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,802
click Auto Generate Animation.

74
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:19,535
The new animator controller will need to be saved.

75
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,070
No action needs to be taken with this

76
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,806
new animator controller.

77
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,349
The transition between states can be

78
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,592
customised if desired, but this is not necessary.

79
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,924
For more information on the animator component

80
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:37,926
and the animator controller, please see the information linked below.

81
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:42,262
It is worth noting that unlike most animator controllers

82
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:44,262
this controller will also store the animations

83
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:46,455
for the button's transitions.

84
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:49,273
With the animator controller attached

85
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,842
and the button element selected the animations for

86
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,842
each of these button's states can be edited

87
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,842
by opening the Animation window.

88
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,825
The animation window can be found under

89
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:01,315
Window - Animation.

90
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,706
Or by using the shortcut keys of

91
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,706
Command 6 on the mac or

92
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:08,095
control 6 on windows.

93
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,416
To select the state to be edited

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,416
use the animation clip pop-up menu

95
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,416
to select the desired clip.

96
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:19,137
With these pre-made controllers there should

97
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:23,371
be a state for normal, highlighted, pressed and disabled.

98
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,453
In most cases the normal state

99
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:29,496
will be left empty with no animation keyframes

100
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,496
created as the normal state will

101
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:34,614
be set by the values on the button element itself.

102
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:38,678
On all other state the most common configuration

103
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,530
for each state is a single keyframe at 0 seconds

104
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,195
or the start of the timeline.

105
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,991
The transition animation between states

106
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,991
will be handled by the animator controller

107
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,991
as it fades between states.

108
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,961
For example the width of the button

109
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,531
in the highlighted state could be changed

110
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,418
by selecting the state to be edited,

111
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,418
in this case Highlighted from the

112
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,418
animation clip pop-up menu

113
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,987
and with the playhead at 0 seconds

114
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:07,821
or the start of the timeline

115
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,957
selecting the record button

116
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:15,319
changing the width of the button in the inspector

117
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,965
and exiting record mode.

118
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
When in play mode note how the

119
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
button now grows when highlighted.

120
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,128
It is worth noting that any number of properties

121
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,452
can have their values set in this one keyframe.

122
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,301
For more information on animation,

123
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,049
animation clips and the animation window

124
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,049
please see the information linked below.

125
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:44,026
If several buttons share the same behaviour

126
00:05:44,026 --> 00:05:46,896
these button elements can share animator controllers.

127
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,976
Make sure all of these buttons have their transition

128
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,976
mode set to Animation.

129
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:57,378
And that they all have an animator component attached.

130
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:03,382
Finally associate the shared animator controller

131
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,382
with all of the button elements.

132
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,335
When in play mode

133
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:13,335
note how all of the buttons now share

134
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:15,335
the same animator transitions.

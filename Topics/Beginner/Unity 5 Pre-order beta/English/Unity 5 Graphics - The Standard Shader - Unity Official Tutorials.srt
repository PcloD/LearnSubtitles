1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,200
The Standard Shader is a powerful and versatile shader,

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,481
This single physically-based shader

3
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,481
can be used to make such a wide variety

4
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:12,481
of materials it's easily

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,481
possible that this one shader can make

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,082
every material in a given project.

7
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:22,987
The standard shader is used to create Unity's default material.

8
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:24,987
So all mesh renderers using

9
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:30,027
the default material will be using the standard shader.

10
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:35,021
All new materials that are created

11
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,674
will use the standard shader as well.

12
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,442
To change the shader used by a material

13
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,067
select the Shader menu on the material.

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,034
Select Standard to use the standard shader.

15
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,895
This physically-based material is

16
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:52,798
still a standard Unity material

17
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:55,131
and this material is associated

18
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:58,911
with a renderer in the same way as usual.

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,750
There are three sections to the standard shader.

20
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:07,037
Rendering Mode.

21
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:09,037
Main Maps

22
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,037
and Secondary Maps.

23
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:16,121
The standard shader has three rendering modes.

24
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,742
Opaque, Cutout and Transparent.

25
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:23,042
Most materials are opaque, or solid materials.

26
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:26,002
Opaque is the default render mode.

27
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:29,669
For transparent materials, such as glass,

28
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:31,669
choose Transparent.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
In transparent rendering mode

30
00:01:34,586 --> 00:01:37,263
the alpha channel on the diffuse colour property

31
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,374
is used to control the level of transparency.

32
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:44,362
With rendering mode 'Cutout'

33
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:46,362
the alpha channel of the diffuse image

34
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:49,466
is used to mask out parts of the texture.

35
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,684
If the alpha channel has a gradient value to the mask

36
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:55,684
the alpha cutoff slider can be used

37
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:57,684
to adjust the shape of the cutout.

38
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,281
based on the strength of the mask in the alpha channel.

39
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,712
The Main Map section defines the look of the material.

40
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:10,277
Before going in to the details of each property

41
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:13,554
there are a few subjects that are worth covering first.

42
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,107
Optimisation.

43
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:19,047
The standard shader is highly optimised.

44
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,589
When the standard shader is built

45
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,589
two important things happen.

46
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:27,674
All properties that are not being used are discarded.

47
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,216
The build target is checked

48
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,883
and the shader is optimised for that device.

49
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:36,629
Because of this there is no need to populate every

50
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,049
property with a map or values.

51
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,657
And there is no need to worry about wasted

52
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,333
resources due to unused properties.

53
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:50,726
Physically-based shading.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,246
Physically-based shading is a different approach to materials

55
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,246
compared to previous versions of Unity.

56
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,385
Physically-based shading tries to define

57
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:02,886
certain physical aspects of a material's surface.

58
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,886
Including it's diffuse colour,

59
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,886
specular refection and other properties

60
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,289
so the material behaves correctly,

61
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,213
and believably in all lighting environments.

62
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:15,259
The response of the scene lighting to the material

63
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,259
created with a physically-based shader

64
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:20,419
mimics light in the real physical world.

65
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,773
This means that even though there is

66
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,773
full control over the values on

67
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:27,547
all of the properties in the standard shader

68
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,547
there are certain ranges of values that

69
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:32,293
work best for certain types of materials.

70
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,614
This is particularly true of the specular colour value.

71
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:39,854
When analysing real-world materials

72
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:41,854
most materials have a specular range

73
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,854
that is a very dark grey.

74
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,504
Metallic materials are one of the few exceptions,

75
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,184
which have very bright specularity.

76
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:53,596
As well, no material, even the most dull,

77
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:56,096
has no specularity at all.

78
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,527
This means to have a phyically-based

79
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,527
material behave correctly

80
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,527
some attention needs to be paid in using

81
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,846
the correct physical values for some key properties,

82
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,426
especially the specular property.

83
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:11,666
For more information on physically-based shading,

84
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,356
material charts and sample materials

85
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:17,076
please see the information linked below.

86
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,315
There is no need to panic however.

87
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:21,805
Items with materials from previous versions of Unity

88
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,560
will work well with Unity 5 out of the box.

89
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:27,806
Upgrading from a legacy diffuse shader

90
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:31,586
to the standard shader should display little or no difference.

91
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,330
In the main map section each of these properties

92
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,910
control one aspect of the final material.

93
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,534
Each property can be defined by a texture map.

94
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:45,193
The diffuse, specular and emission properties

95
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:47,847
use a texture and a colour property

96
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,667
where the texture is optional.

97
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:54,301
The diffuse property uses a combination

98
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,301
of an optional texture.

99
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,745
And a colour value to define the base

100
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:01,252
look of the material.

101
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:04,745
The colour value will tint the texture.

102
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:09,951
Where pure white leave the main texture unaffected.

103
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,729
If there is no texture being used

104
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,044
the tint colour will be the base colour for the material.

105
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,850
The specular property can either be a texture

106
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:22,734
or a colour value

107
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,530
and defines the specular reflectivity

108
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,530
of the material's surface.

109
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,468
The specular value can have some colour in it

110
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,719
but looking at real-world values,

111
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:34,719
with the exception of some metals,

112
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:37,950
this is usually a grey and often very dark.

113
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,895
Specular maps are usually a dark grey as well.

114
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,348
When a specular texture map is not being used

115
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,348
the overall surface smoothness

116
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,348
can be set with the slider.

117
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,778
This is easier to see when the

118
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,778
diffuse texture is removed.

119
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,322
The ball looks like polished porcelain.

120
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:04,676
For a more true mirror push the specular from dark grey,

121
00:06:04,676 --> 00:06:06,957
which makes the ball look like porcelain,

122
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,407
in to the range of metals, and it will now reflect

123
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,769
the sky and surroundings.

124
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:15,936
The smoother the surface, the more it is mirror-like.

125
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,044
The rougher the surface, the more diffuse,

126
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,604
or scattered the reflections are.

127
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:25,326
The normal map property is an optional property used

128
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:28,111
to define the apparent bumpiness of the surface.

129
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,108
When a normal map is applied

130
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,646
the strength of the normal map can be controlled

131
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:36,291
by adjusting the normal map value.

132
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,638
As well as positive numbers, this value can be

133
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,638
a negative number or 0.

134
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:46,096
The height map property is an optional property

135
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:49,312
used to define the apparent height of the surface.

136
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,090
When a height map is applied

137
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,701
the strength of the height map can be controlled

138
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,701
by adjusting the height map value.

139
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,854
The occlusion property used a

140
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,854
texture map to define the amount of

141
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,853
ambient occlusion that is applied to the material.

142
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:08,714
This is used to help darken

143
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:11,376
hidden or recessed areas on the texture.

144
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,857
The ambient occlusion map also prevents specular

145
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:17,742
and reflections in these occluded areas

146
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:20,080
giving the material a more realistic look

147
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,642
The emission property controls whether or not

148
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,642
the material's surface will emit light.

149
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,100
To emit no light the emission colour should be black

150
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,475
or the emission value should be 0.

151
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,547
The material's emission value can contribute

152
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,547
to the scene's global illumination.

153
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,547
First a colour other than black needs

154
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:44,215
to be chosen to be able to emit light.

155
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,159
The strength of the emission can be controlled

156
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,159
by the emission value.

157
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:51,506
The shape of the emission can be controlled

158
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:53,286
with an emission map.

159
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,980
The map can be a simple black and white map.

160
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,231
But this texture can also be a colour map.

161
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,078
When there is a value for emission

162
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:04,078
the contribution of the emissive light

163
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:07,047
can be assigned to either the baked light maps

164
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,047
or to the real-time light maps.

165
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:14,017
The detail mask property is an optional mask element

166
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,557
to control the secondary maps.

167
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:20,299
Tiling and offset control the position of the map.

168
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,001
The secondary maps are used to define

169
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,001
additional surface detail.

170
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:27,001
This additional detail, sometimes referred to

171
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:29,491
as micro detail, is added on top

172
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,431
of the surface defined by the main maps.

173
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,838
This helps to add extra detail and

174
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,533
variation to a material,

175
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,533
which is overlaid on top of the main maps

176
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,013
defining that material.

177
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:44,463
Because detail maps can be tiled across meshes

178
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:47,934
they can add incredibly high levels of surface detail.

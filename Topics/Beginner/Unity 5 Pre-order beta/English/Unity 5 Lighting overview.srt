1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,300
Lighting in Unity 5 is more fully featured than in any previous versions of Unity.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,620
The lighting pipeline now includes Realtime Global Illumination in addition to traditional Baked lightmapping.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:20,220
This, combined with the physically based Standard Shader, gives you more power and versatility to easily light more complex scenes.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,700
One of the key differences in the lighting pipeline is Unity’s new Realtime Global Illumination or “GI”.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,740
GI is available for all lights working in the scene. 

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,660
This means that all lights in the scene affect the objects within range with indirect illumination as well as direct illumination.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,180
Direct Illumination comes from the light shining on the objects in the scene.

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,480
Indirect Illumination, however, is the light reflected, or bounced off of, other surfaces in the scene.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,280
Direct and Indirect light will blend together to create a much more realistic look.

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,500
A new scene in Unity comes with a default skybox 

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,620
and a default directional light that is aligned with the skybox, in addition to the default main camera.

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,740
Each scene also contains ambient light, which can be comprised of a number of factors.

13
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,120
In the Lighting panel’s Scene tab, we have options for ambient light

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,820
with a choice of skybox colour

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,860
a user defined gradient of 3 colours

16
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,060
or a single colour.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:36,340
This means that any object added to the scene will receive this light, unless values are set to black.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,315
When lighting scenes in Unity 5, we can work with real-time lighting

19
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,880
baked lighting or a mixture of both approaches.

20
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,000
Real-time lighting is more easily modified at runtime, but comes at a cost to performance.

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,660
Baked lighting pre-calculates much more detailed lighting information 

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,100
and saves it to a lightmap - a texture on disk.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,340
This lightmap information is read from disk at runtime

24
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,260
and this approach avoids the need to do calculations later, saving performance at runtime.

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,740
Using Baked lighting exclusively would be more appropriate for devices with lower performance capabilities, 

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,740
such as mobile platforms.

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,360
Lights can be switched between Realtime, Baked and Mixed lighting on a per light basis. 

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,640
The light mapping system can work in either "Iterative" mode, or "On Demand" mode.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,120
Iterative mode will bake any lighting changes in the background as you edit properties.

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,840
On Demand mode will only preview changes once the "Bake" button in the Lighting panel has been selected

31
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,540
 in a similar way to how previous versions of Unity functioned with baked lighting. 

32
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,900
In this scene, we have a directional light coming in through the sky light at the top

33
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,480
casting shadows that you can see around the chamber area from the furniture inside.

34
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,460
This light contributes to the illumination for the rest of the scene 

35
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:27,113
because it bounces from the surfaces it lights directly onto others.

36
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:33,359
If I decrease the intensity of this light, you can see the illumination of the room decreases also.

37
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:36,360
Likewise if we simply rotate the directional light

38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,094
you can see that as it has moved to directly light a different part of the scene

39
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:46,838
we can see the light now bounces to illuminate the ceiling more effectively.

40
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:55,914
The rest of the room is lit with Point and Spot lights as well as Emissive surfaces.

41
00:03:55,914 --> 00:04:02,554
This means that we can give our scene a very different feel by changing some of the colour values in the contributing lights. 

42
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:06,055
As these elements are part of the realtime lightmapping

43
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:10,295
we can also control these lights at runtime using coding or animation.

44
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:15,814
This allows us to create complex changes in mood during our games and projects. 

45
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:20,654
As the new standard shader can mimic a wide array of physical surfaces in your projects

46
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:26,134
you can expect certain materials to have different amounts of reflectivity as far as light is concerned

47
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:30,714
To help balance this, you can either adjust Bounce Intensity on a per light basis

48
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:33,655
or globally using the settings in the Lighting Panel.

49
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,300
Albedo scale lets you artificially increase the potential bounce for dark scenes.

50
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:47,994
Indirect scale allows you to boost or decrease indirect light in the scene for realtime and baked lightmaps.

51
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:51,760
Direct scale allows you to boost the light in baked lightmaps.

52
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,660
AO Exponent controls the amount of Ambient Occlusion and also only applies to baked lightmaps

53
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,514
allowing you to darken bounced lighting in occluded areas.

54
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:06,314
In addition to lights, we can use Emissive surfaces to contribute to lighting.

55
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:09,554
In this scene we can see a lit panel around the ceiling of the room

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,260
and various strips of geometry in the wall panels

57
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,398
 all of these utilise the standard shader’s Emissive property

58
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:22,158
You can see that by adjusting the emission scale - the float value next to the property -

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,580
and adding a touch of colour, we can vastly change the mood of our scene.

60
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:43,813
The final contributory factor in lighting your Unity scenes are Probes. 

61
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:48,233
There are now two types of Probe in Unity - Light and Reflection probes. 

62
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:51,913
Light probes function in much the same way as in previous versions of Unity,

63
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:56,793
acting as a grid of points via which you can sample the light at different positions in the world,

64
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,820
and cast it upon dynamic objects such as characters and other moving elements, with low performance cost.

65
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,260
Reflection probes act as a single point of reference for reflection,

66
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:13,900
with an accompanying cubic volume to allow you to specify what should be included in the reflection.

67
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,855
These probes sample elements surrounding them using box projection

68
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:21,793
and store the information in a cubemap.

69
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:26,573
Materials with reflective shaders that are on objects within the Reflection probe’s volume, 

70
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,979
can then reference that cubemap to create reflective surfaces. 

71
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,055
As such, you should keep this in mind when designing the lighting of your scenes,

72
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:40,015
as the reflectivity of surfaces should be factored into the overall lighting.

73
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:48,634
So ultimately, lighting in Unity 5 is a balance of ambient light, direct and indirect light and reflections.

74
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:55,574

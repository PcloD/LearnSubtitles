1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:03,765
In Unity it's possible to control the

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:07,269
volume of one element in your audio mix

3
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:09,953
based on the volume of another.

4
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:12,825
This is called ducking and we achieve this

5
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:15,482
using the Duck Volume effect.

6
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:18,625
I've got a simple scene setup here with

7
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,826
three musical parts, a kick drum,

8
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:24,411
bass line and arpeggio, these are all assigned

9
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:26,411
to game object which have

10
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:30,256
audio source component which are assigned

11
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:33,454
to different outputs in our audio mixer.

12
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:35,694
The kick has it's own group

13
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:39,186
and the synthesisers, the bass line and

14
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,186
arpeggio are both routed

15
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:44,178
to the synthesiser group.

16
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,539
What we're going to do is we're going to cause

17
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,874
the volume of the synthesisers to duck

18
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,307
based on the volume of the kick drum when it strikes.

19
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:58,321
This is also called side chain compression.

20
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:03,397
To begin I'm going to add a duck volume effect

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,916
using the Add drop down menu.

22
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:09,531
Now that the duck volume effect has been added

23
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:12,665
I'm going to send some audio signal to it

24
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:15,664
and I'm going to do this using the Send effect.

25
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,914
I'm going to click Add and choose Send.

26
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,337
Now in the inspector

27
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:25,137
I'm going to choose the bus

28
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,416
for the send to be routed to.

29
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,416
In this case that's going to be

30
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,988
synthesisers duck volume.

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,180
Now that we've setup our routing

32
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,180
we're going to set the send level.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Because the input

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,660
on the duck volume effect does not route

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,415
it's signal back to the main volume

36
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,770
we can turn up this send without

37
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,944
adding any volume to our mix.

38
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,683
This is a typical behaviour for a side

39
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:55,683
chain input on a compressor.

40
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,683
With the volume turned all the way up

41
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,683
now the full amplitude of our

42
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:04,556
kick will reach the duck volume effect when it plays.

43
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,966
Let's listen to the scene first.

44
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,831
Now even though we've configured our scene

45
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,831
we're still not hearing any gain reduction

46
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,462
from the duck volume.

47
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,708
If we click on the duck volume effect

48
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,938
we can configure it's parameters.

49
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,577
The threshold is the volume at which

50
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:36,378
gain reduction will begin to occur.

51
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,378
So our input signal, in this case

52
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:40,823
our kick drum, will need to exceed a

53
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:44,146
threshold of -10 decibels

54
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,875
before we start to apply any gain reduction.

55
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,875
Let's listen to that in action.

56
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,748
We're going to play

57
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,556
turn on Edit In Play Mode so that we can

58
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,095
change the parameters

59
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:59,287
and we're going to slowly reduce the threshold.

60
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,336
And so you can hear as we reduce the

61
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,336
threshold we start to hear that

62
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,287
pumping breathing effect

63
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,287
because the amplitude of the kick drum

64
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:21,988
is now causing our duck volume effect

65
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:24,153
to lower the amplitude

66
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,249
or volume of the synthesiser group.

67
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:29,364
Now we can move on to our next parameter,

68
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:31,115
which is called the ratio.

69
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:34,247
The ratio determines how much gain reduction

70
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,247
will be applied once

71
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,247
the threshold is triggered.

72
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,385
One easy way to think about this is that

73
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:44,456
it's the amount of gain reduction which is

74
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,456
applied once the threshold is exceeded.

75
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:07,589
Next we have the attack time and the release time.

76
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:10,592
The attack time is once the threshold

77
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:14,137
has been triggered, how quick is the onset

78
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,380
of the gain reduction?

79
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
The release time is the opposite.

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,476
Once the attack phase is completed,

81
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,090
so in this case after 26 milliseconds,

82
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,951
the release time begins to release

83
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:27,232
the compression or the gain reduction.

84
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,639
And so in this case after 100 milliseconds

85
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,878
we will no longer be reducing volume

86
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:36,028
so we'll be back to our original signal strength.

87
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,989
The makeup gain is simply an

88
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:58,249
additional volume control

89
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,249
that allows us to make back up

90
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,249
some of the gain that we've reduced.

91
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,249
In this case because we want to have a

92
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,249
pronounced ducking effect where we hear the volume

93
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:08,462
getting quieter we're going to leave the makeup

94
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:11,275
gain at 0, which means that no change

95
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,275
in volume is going to be applied.

96
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:17,217
The knee controls the behaviour of the threshold.

97
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,262
At a very low or hard knee

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,994
we're going to get a linear transition

99
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,994
from once the threshold is crossed

100
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,878
we're going to begin applying gain.

101
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:31,074
If we increase the knee value or soften it,

102
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,064
we're going to see that we're going to have a

103
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:35,064
much more smooth transition

104
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,345
as the gain reduction is applied.

105
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,345
And it's actually possible at high knee values,

106
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:41,596
as you can see from the graph changing,

107
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,943
to begin reducing gain even before

108
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,943
the threshold has been tripped.

109
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,843
As we approach the threshold at a soft knee value

110
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:52,255
we're going to begin to see some gain reduction

111
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,671
even before we've exceeded the threshold.

112
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:59,138
The side chain mix allows us to blend

113
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:01,138
between the effected

114
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:03,138
and the unaffected signal.

115
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:06,462
At 100% we're listening to

116
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,462
only the signal which is being 

117
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:10,462
processed by the duck volume.

118
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,742
At 0 we're going to be listening to

119
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:14,742
only the original signal.

120
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,260
In addition to being able to adjust the parameters

121
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
via the sliders we can also

122
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
adjust the parameters by clicking directly

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,522
on the graphic.

124
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:25,771
If we click on the white line here representing

125
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:29,698
threshold we can actually drag horizontally

126
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,872
to adjust the threshold value.

127
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,007
By dragging vertically we can adjust the knee

128
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,643
and you'll see we have this nice representation

129
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:40,127
of how the knee is effecting the threshold.

130
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,733
If we drag to the left of the line we can

131
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,733
adjust the makeup gain

132
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,733
and if we drag to the right of the line we can

133
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,325
adjust the ratio.

1
00:00:00,702 --> 00:00:02,587
In Unity's audio mixer

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,587
the send and receive effects

3
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,924
give us a great deal of control

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,717
over how our signals are routed

5
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:13,184
through the mix and particularly to effects.

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,824
In this scene we have four game objects,

7
00:00:16,824 --> 00:00:19,848
each with an audio source and an audio clip

8
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:22,686
loaded that's a loop of a music track.

9
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:29,159
In our mixer we've setup two effect return tracks.

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,833
These are normal groups which have respectively a reverb

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,295
on reverb return and an echo effect

12
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:38,074
on echo return.

13
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:40,074
Currently they are not receiving

14
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,373
signal from any other the other tracks in the mixer.

15
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,936
But if we want to get a signal to them

16
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:50,320
we can do that using the send and receive effects.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,601
Let's start with our arpeggio sound,

18
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,017
which sounds like this.

19
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:02,966
What we're going to do is that we're going to use

20
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:06,532
a send effect to split the signal so that our

21
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:08,078
arpeggio will continue to be routed

22
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:10,078
through the master output but will

23
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,638
also have a duplicate of it's signal

24
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:15,155
with a controllable volume sent

25
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:17,541
in this case to the reverb return.

26
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,567
So first we're going to go to our reverb return track

27
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,602
and we're going to setup our destination, our receive.

28
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:25,832
We're going to choose Add - Receive.

29
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,459
Now it's important to note that the

30
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,638
sequence of these effects in the channel strip

31
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:34,108
is very important.

32
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:37,294
In this case the signal from the receive effect is

33
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:40,007
coming in to the chain after the reverb,

34
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,528
meaning that it's signal will not be processed

35
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:43,685
by the reverb effect.

36
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,545
What we're going to do is move the reverb down

37
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:49,746
so it's in the chain after the receive.

38
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,055
Now we're going to go to our arpeggio and we're going to

39
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:54,228
apply a send effect, we're going to choose

40
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:56,228
Add - Send.

41
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:58,545
Now we'll see over in the inspector

42
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:03,637
that we have a choice for what bus to route the send to.

43
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:06,011
The term bus comes from the world of

44
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,655
audio mixers in which a bus can be used

45
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:12,491
to route signal from one channel 

46
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:15,258
to another or two multiple other channels.

47
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,578
In this case the choice is between

48
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,846
routing to a receive effect

49
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,250
or to a duck volume effect.

50
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,048
For more on duck volume effects

51
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:27,289
check out the information linked below.

52
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,528
We're going to choose our reverb return receive effect.

53
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:37,887
Now we'll notice that a send level becomes visible.

54
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,787
This is how much duplicated signal

55
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,330
is being routed to the receive effect.

56
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:46,234
We're going to start playing and turn that up

57
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,234
so we can hear the effect happen.

58
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,666
And you can hear when I stop it we get

59
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,945
that nice reverb tail

60
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:17,540
tailing off there because now the arpeggio sound

61
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,328
has been routed through the receive effect,

62
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:23,033
through the SFX reverb plugin

63
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,912
and that's creating that nice cycle acoustic impression

64
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:30,353
of our sound being played in a large space.

65
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,987
What reverb effects do is they simulate

66
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:36,505
the reflections of sound

67
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:40,030
bouncing off of surfaces and returning to the listener

68
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,685
in an acoustic space.

69
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:44,442
Our synthesiser sound never occurred in an acoustic

70
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,057
space so it has no natural reflection

71
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:50,191
and we're adding those using the reverb effect.

72
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:52,191
It's worth noting when we work with

73
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,409
reverb effects via sends and receives

74
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,390
that the dry level should be turned all the way down

75
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,878
so that we don't duplicate the unaffected signal.

76
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,217
It's also worth noting that the order

77
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:10,960
of the attenuation and the send in our group is important.

78
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,937
Currently the attenuation effect is before the send,

79
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:17,741
meaning if we turn down volume

80
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,513
using the attenuation effect the signal will stop

81
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,880
passing to the send, let's give that a try.

82
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:28,546
We can hear the trail trails off

83
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,182
and the sound ends.

84
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:34,629
If we reorder these effects we'll get a different effect.

85
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,629
We're going to place the attenuation after the end

86
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,985
and what you'll hear is that by

87
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:43,852
placing the send before the attenuation effect

88
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:47,634
the send is not going to have it's volume turned down,

89
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:50,028
it will still receive volume

90
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:53,579
before the attenuation turns the signal down.

91
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,191
The result is that the send is going to continue sending

92
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,936
signal out even though the main channel is turned off.

93
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:13,588
What we can hear in this case is that whether or not

94
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,510
the volume is turned down the send is still

95
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,548
getting it's volume out to the reverb return

96
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:21,548
and not what we're hearing is only

97
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:24,195
the wet signal of the reverb

98
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:27,206
coming back in to the main mix via the reverb return.

99
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,738
This can be interesting for some non-traditional effects

100
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:32,142
but typically you're going to prefer

101
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,984
attenuation followed by your send.

102
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,821
It's also worth noting as I mentioned earlier

103
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:41,664
that if the receive effect is after,

104
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,664
for example the reverb in this case,

105
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:56,217
we're going to receive no effect, so it's important for any effects

106
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:58,217
that you want to process your signal to be

107
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:01,034
placed in the chain after the receive effect.

108
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:04,014
Now one of the other major uses of sends

109
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:06,800
is that we can use it to process 

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,250
multiple channels with the same effect.

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,250
So in this track we also have

112
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,035
a percussion element.

113
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:17,241
And what we can do, by adding a send

114
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,755
to that and routing that also to the reverb,

115
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,244
we can add reverb, the same reverb

116
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,811
to both of our tracks.

117
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,567
So we can hear this gives us a very

118
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,883
consistent psycho-acoustic impression,

119
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:46,267
which is especially important if we're aiming for realism.

120
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,779
To have things passing in to the same reverbs

121
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,679
so that they feel like they're emanating in the same environment.

122
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,946
It's also possible to use send and receive effects

123
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:58,403
to route one signal to multiple effects.

124
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:00,778
What we're going to do is we're going to send our

125
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:05,210
arpeggio additionally to our

126
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,775
echo effect on our echo return group.

127
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,448
We're going to add a receive effect

128
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,982
to the echo return and move it up in the

129
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:15,903
chain so that it's signal will pass through the echo.

130
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:18,894
Then on the arpeggio we're going to add a send

131
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,249
and assign it's output to

132
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:24,914
the echo return receive.

133
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:27,326
once that's assigned we can test.

134
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:50,234
And you can hear with that nice tail

135
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:54,008
that our arpeggio is now being passed to both

136
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:57,726
the reverb return and the echo return

137
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:01,202
groups that we've created here via the two receive effects.

138
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:03,044
What's great about this setup is that we can

139
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:07,164
control the levels individually using the send volumes

140
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:09,164
and we can really achieve a lot of flexibility

141
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:11,164
in our mix this way.

142
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:14,649
It's also worth noting that this is a common

143
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:18,150
audio industry best practice because

144
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:22,318
processing audio signals, especially with reverb can

145
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,945
be very processor intense.

146
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:27,959
Having a reverb on each of these tracks

147
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,303
could have a serious CPU resource cost at run time.

148
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,303
So minimising our use of effects

149
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:38,000
by sending multiple effects to the same 

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,306
reverb on a return track

151
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,901
is going to save us some CPU

152
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:45,650
resources that we'll probably need elsewhere in our game.

1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,360
Unity's built-in profiler

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,860
allows us to quickly and accurately

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,750
assess the performance of our games.

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,060
Using this information we can keep our scenes running

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,060
smoothly and efficiently.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,190
In Unity we can access the profiler

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,310
by clicking Window - Profiler.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,540
Or by pressing Control-7 in Windows

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,540
or Command-7 on a Mac.

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,330
The profiler window functions just like every other

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,840
Unity editor window and can be easily docked

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,390
so that it is more readily available.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,270
Once the profiler is open

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,270
statistics will be collected about our scene

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,270
every time it is run.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,020
Let's run our scene now and pause execution

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,020
after a few frames.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,700
Now that the profiler has some data,

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,180
we can begin examining it.

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,760
The profiler window itself is split in to 3 sections.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,080
The first is the profiler area section

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,490
where we can see the various measurements being recorded.

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,480
Next we have an overview

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
where we can get a detailed breakdown

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
of each profiler area.

26
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,730
Finally we have the pre-object display

27
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,730
where we can get information about the

28
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,730
items in our overview.

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:30,130
By default the profiler measures CPU usage, GPU usage,

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,500
rendering performance, memory usage, audio,

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,100
and physics for both 3D and 2D.

32
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,080
Any of these can be selected to get more information

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
in the overview window.

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,400
To the right of the profiler area section

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,850
is a color chart outlining the specific performance

36
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,840
of different pieces of each area.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,850
For instance, in the CPU Usage component, 

38
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,610
we can see that rendering usage is freed

39
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,060
whilst Script Performance is blue.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
We can switch these different sections on

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,620
and off by clicking the box next to their names.

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,530
Clicking anywhere in the color chart will give you a vertical line.

43
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,380
The line represents a specific frame of recorded data.

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,630
We can see what frame we are on

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,630
and the total number of frames

46
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,430
by looking at the frame count in the upper righthand corner.

47
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,240
We will also see some numbers appear around our line.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,640
These numbers represent the amount of time

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,580
in milliseconds each of the sessions took

50
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,580
during that specific frame.

51
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,480
Obviously lower numbers mean faster games.

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,780
We can see the specific information for the selected frame

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,780
in the overview section.

54
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,560
Items in the overview section with an arrow next

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,420
to them can be expanded for more information.

56
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,480
With all of this information at your fingertips

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
you will be able to more readily determine

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,700
the performance of your games and optimise them.

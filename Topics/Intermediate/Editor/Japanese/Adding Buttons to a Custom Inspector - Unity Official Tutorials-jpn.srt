1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:02,021
In Unity we can add buttons to

2
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:04,021
editor windows so that we can call the

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,694
functions from our scripts.

4
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,329
Doing so gives us the ability to

5
00:00:08,329 --> 00:00:11,502
write scripts specifically to improve our workflow,

6
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,502
and that is always a good thing.

7
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:18,157
Here we have a script called ObjectBuilderScript

8
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:20,676
The purpose of this script is to instantiate

9
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,676
an object at any given point

10
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,676
using the BuildObject method.

11
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:29,048
First we declare a game object

12
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:33,504
named obj and a vector3 named spawnPoint.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,519
These will contain the object being built

14
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,644
and the location to build it respectively.

15
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:44,221
After that we have our method BuildObject,

16
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,850
which handles instantiating our object.

17
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,542
We also have a custom inspector script

18
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:53,542
written for our object builder script

19
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,922
named ObjectBuilderEditor.

20
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:00,855
For more information on writing custom inspector scripts

21
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:04,197
see the lesson on custom inspectors linked below.

22
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,475
The first thing we have inside the

23
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:09,475
OnInspectorGUI method is the

24
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:11,475
DrawDefaultInspector function.

25
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:14,669
More information on this function can be found

26
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,669
in the lesson linked below.

27
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:22,872
Next we create a button which when clicked

28
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:25,122
will call the BuildObject method

29
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:27,122
of the ObjectBuilderScript.

30
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:31,045
To do this we first create a variable to

31
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:33,418
hold our ObjectBuilderScript reference

32
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,418
named myScript.

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,405
We set our myScript variable

34
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:41,905
equal to a cast of the inherited target variable.

35
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:45,370
Casting allow us to treat the target variable

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,681
as if it was an ObjectBuilderScript variable.

37
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,599
We then create our button by writing the

38
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,599
GUILayout class name

39
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,881
followed by a . and the Button function.

40
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,409
We parse in a single parameter,

41
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,822
which contains the text we want displayed on the button.

42
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,323
The Button function returns a boolean

43
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:10,685
that is true if the button is pressed.

44
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:15,253
Therefore we wrap the whole line up in an If statement.

45
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:18,989
Then when the If statement

46
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,713
evaluates to true we simply call the

47
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:25,846
BuildObject method of our myScript variable.

48
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,527
In Unity we have a scene with

49
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,527
an empty game object in it.

50
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,971
Attached to the game object is our

51
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,971
ObjectBuilderScript.

52
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:39,367
Notice in the inspector, in addition to the 2

53
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,367
fields we declared in the script

54
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,836
we also have a button that says Build Object.

55
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,738
If we click the Build Object button

56
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:51,582
we can see that an orb is created in the scene.

57
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:55,342
By changing the values of the Spawn Position field

58
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,342
we can keep building objects at various

59
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,342
places around the scene.

60
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:03,827
We can see that adding functions to our inspector

61
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,701
allows us to add a lot of custom

62
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,840
functionality when working in Unity.

00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:03,558
In Unity we can create a custom inspector to control

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:05,558
which data from our scripts is visible

3
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:07,558
and how it is represented in the editor.

4
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:11,547
That ability to extend the editor in this way

5
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:14,507
gives us a lot of power and flexibility with our scripts

6
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:16,507
and the resulting workflow.

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:19,997
Let's say we had a leveling system

8
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:23,729
where every time a character earned 750 experience points

9
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:25,224
they gained a new level.

10
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:29,140
This is easy enough to calculate in the beginning

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,699
but it could be a bit combersome as characters get

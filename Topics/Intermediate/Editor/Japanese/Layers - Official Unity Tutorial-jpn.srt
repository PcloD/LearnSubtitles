1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,993
Layers are used to indicate some functionality

2
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:05,815
across many different game objects in Unity.

3
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,820
For instance, layers can be used to indicate

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,820
which object should be drawn in the

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,436
scene view, should ignore raycasts,

6
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,813
or are invisible to the camera.

7
00:00:18,013 --> 00:00:20,502
Here we have a scene with 2 orbs in it.

8
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:24,897
We can see that both orbs are on the layer Default.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,671
If we wanted to change the layer of 1 of the orbs

10
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,555
we could click the Layer drop-down in the inspector

11
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:34,555
and select a new layer.

12
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:37,878
We can see that this orb is now on the

13
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:39,878
Ignore Raycast layer

14
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:43,499
and will not be hit by any raycasts that pass through it.

15
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:48,296
We also have the ability to define our own layers.

16
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:52,415
We can do so using the Tag And Layer Manager window.

17
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:56,144
To access the tag and layer manager window

18
00:00:56,144 --> 00:00:59,843
either select Add Layer from the Layers drop-down

19
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:06,248
or click Edit - Project Settings - Tags And Layers.

20
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:10,432
Here we can see all of the built-in layers

21
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:12,432
as well as add our own.

22
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:17,195
Let's create an Ignored By Camera layer.

23
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:20,292
We can place our other sphere

24
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,292
on this newly created layer

25
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:27,586
by selecting it and choosing the New Ignored By Camera layer

26
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,586
from the Layers drop-down.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,143
This sphere is now on the

28
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,143
Ignored By Camera layer.

29
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:39,115
The layer has no inherent functionality however

30
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,716
so let's modify our camera to ignore it.

31
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:47,041
In the Culling Mask property of a camera

32
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,745
we can select which layers are seen by the camera

33
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,745
and which are not.

34
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:54,515
By clicking the drop-down and

35
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,885
unselecting the Ignored By Camera layer

36
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,295
all objects on that layer will no longer

37
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,807
be visible to that camera.

38
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:05,743
Let's run our scene.

39
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:08,773
We can see that only a single orb appears.

40
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:13,843
The other orb, the one on the Ignored By Camera Layer

41
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,843
is not rendered to the screen.

42
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:19,397
We can also use layers to determine

43
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,701
what appears in the scene view.

44
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,320
By clicking on the Scene Layers drop-down

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,897
at the top right of the Unity editor

46
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,610
we can select and deselect layers.

47
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:34,392
Doing so will cause all objects

48
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:36,517
on those layers to disappear.

00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:02,307
The Ternary Operator is a condensed form

2
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:04,307
for an If Else statement.

3
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:06,884
In it's most basic form the ternary operator

4
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:08,480
is used for deciding between two values

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,480
based on some Boolean expression.

6
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:12,917
The syntax has the format

7
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:18,739
Boolean ? true expression : false expression.

8
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,975
The first parameter is the Boolean, or condition

9
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,851
which evaluates to a Boolean

10
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:24,589
that you wish to test.

11
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,089
The end of this parameter is marked

12
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,635
with a question mark.

13
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:29,635
The next parameter is the value of the ternary

14
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:31,635
operator would evaluate to if the condition

15
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:34,563
is true. This is followed by a colon.

16
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:36,242
Then the final parameter is the value that

17
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:38,007
the ternary operator would evaluate to if

18
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,604
the condition is false.

19
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,855
Here we use a simple ternary operator

20
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:44,720
to determine if a player is alive or dead.

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,276
Ternary operators can be nested within 

22
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:49,263
one another but if used for long expressions

23
00:00:49,263 --> 00:00:52,732
this can make code cumbersome and difficult to read.

24
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:54,997
A general rule for when to use a ternary operator

25
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,997
instead of an If Statement is if your code

26
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:58,997
needs a simple If Else structure with

27
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:02,232
a single short expression in each case.
